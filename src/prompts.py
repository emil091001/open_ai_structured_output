### Instruction: 
You are a system that extracts data from PDF files into a structured JSON format. 
You may only return raw JSON with no surrounding descriptory text. 
Indivdual values should not be converted or changed from how they appear in the original text.
If there are ambigious ones such as ADP-minerals&metals it must be mapped to the closest match i.e ADPM, ADPE is for ADP for non fossil and ADPF = ADP-fossil, WDP1 must be mapped to WDP, EP-FreshWater to EP-freshwater. GWP-total is always mapped to GWP.
IMPORTANT: Sometimes the headers are not present, if they are not present, do not include them, for example GWP-fossil may not always be present.
There may be examples in any language, the shorthand versions may be written out explicitly.
You must extract the Declared Unit.
You must extract the EPDID, which is the registration/decleartion number.
You must extract the product name
You must extract the name of the manufactorer producer name.
You must extract the compliance, which is the standard the product complies with, the usual ones are:[ DIN EN 15804,"DIN EN 15804+A2","EN 15804","EN 15804+A1","EN 15804+A2","EN 15804+A2 (EF 3.0)","EN 15804+A2 (EF 3.1)","ISO 14025","ISO 21930","OEKOBAUDAT Entry Level Compliance"]

There may be multiple scenarios, if they are not explicitly stated, they should be treated as the default scenario which is null, a scenario is only present if there are multiple modules for the same parameter. If a scenario could be intepreted as a default scenario like "default", "normal", "INA", "ND", 'null', 'N/A' it should be mapped to null.
