Product
Product description:
The Falcon A90° 30W is an efficient asymmetrical floodlight equipped with an adjustable stainless steel bracket. The luminaire projects light at an
80° angle when positioned 90° against a wall. The angle can be adjusted to provide more or less coverage based on specific lighting requirements.
This makes the Falcon A90° 30W ideal for illuminating garage doors or smaller outdoor areas.
Product specification
The product is supplied with a 1-meter cable and plug and is rated IK08 for impact resistance and IP65 for water and dust protection. Key
features: Asymmetrical light distribution: Efficiently illuminates smaller areas with adjustable angles for tailored coverage. Adjustable bracket:
Stainless steel construction allows precise angle customization. Durability: IK08 impact rating and IP65 weatherproof classification for robust
performance. Convenient installation: Comes with a 1-meter cable and plug for easy setup.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) can be excluded. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

The analysis is a cradle-to-grave study made for one luminaire manufactured , installed and used in a tunnel over the lifetime. Modules A1-A5 are
included in the analysis. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the factory, the production process itself,
transportation to market and installation of the product. B6 is the operational energy usage based on a normal use. C1-C4, D are mandatory
modules which include end of life treatment of materials and the benefits from recycling.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = Truck freight from factory to port in China 40 km, sea freight from China to Europe 11 500 km, truck freight from port to
warehouse Norway 20 km, truck freight from warehouse to customer in Norway 300 km.
Modules A5 = No energy use has been quantified since installation in buildings is often done by manual labor. Use of portable electrical devices
(e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off criterion of 1%
Module B6 = The operational energy use of the luminaire is calculated based on the methodology provided in IBU PCR Part B for luminaires,
lamps, and components for luminaires. The energy consumption model for luminaire used in the PCR follows the application scenarios developed
in EN 15193:2007. To calculate the electricity use of the luminaire, the following scenario parameters have been applied:
- Active power of the luminaire (Pa) = 30 watt
- Passive power of the luminaire (Pp) = 0 watt
- Daylight time usage (tD) = 0 hours
- Non-daylight time usage (tN) = 1825.00 hours
- Standard year time (ty) = 8760 hours
- The occupancy depency factor (FO) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The daylight dependency factor (FD) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The product specific constant illuminance factor (FCP) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The non-daylight dimming factor (FN) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The application specific empiric lifetime of the luminaire in years (a) = 10 years (corresponding to the reference service life of the product).
Module C1 = De-installation of luminaires is often done by manual labor and only in some cases with machines. Energy use is only relevant when
installed with aid from machines. The use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off
criterion of 1% and can often be neglected.
Module C2 = 85 km is the average default transportation from demolition to waste treatment facility.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
