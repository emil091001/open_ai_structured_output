(user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption', 'potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems', 'potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - cancer effects', 'potential comparative toxic unit for humans â€“ non-cancer effects', 'potential soil
quality index': The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
or as there is limited experience with the indicator.
The major contributor across all environmental impact indicators (except GWP-biogenic) is module A1. This is expected since the
Kvadrat Acoustics Track is a product kit, the entire manufacturing of components takes place in Kvadrat Acoustics A/S upstream supply
chain. Modules A3 and A1 have the lowest negative impact in the GWP-biogenic indicator due to the production of core
board/corrugated cardboard (sales packaging) and wooden pallets (incoming packaging), respectively. In addition, the activities taking
place in Kvadrat Acoustics sites relate to the storing, moving and preparing of the product kit which does not require high energy
consumption. Therefore, module A3 has a low contribution to the environmental impacts. Materials with secondary content are used in
the mineral glass wool and are included in some secondary datasets. Finally, the use of secondary fuels is included in secondary
datasets yet no secondary fuels are used in Kvadrat Acoustics sites.
