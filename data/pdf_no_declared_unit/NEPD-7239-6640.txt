Product
Product description:
Splitter with high insertion loss and broadband attenuation even in the low frequency range.
Sound attenuator splitters with resonating panels, ready to be used in ventilation and air conditioning systems.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/splitters/mk-1349ac4f5547bf7f
Product specification
Sound attenuator splitters used for the reduction of fan noise and air-regenerated noise in air conditioning systems. Attenuation effect due to
absorption and resonance. Energy-saving as well as hygiene tested.Installation kit consists of an aerodynamically profiled frame
(bullnose radius of 20 mm), sound absorbing material and resonating panels.
The splitter frame reduces pressure losses and air-regenerated noise. The special profile helps to reduce the weight and increase the rigidity of the
splitters. Frame edges with bullnose to protect the sound absorbing infill.
Insertion loss and sound power level of the air-regenerated noise tested to ISO 7235.
Meets the hygiene requirements of VDI 6022, VDI 3803 Part 1 and DIN 1946 Part 4.
For use in areas with potentially explosive atmospheres (ATEX), zones 1, 2, 21 and 22 (outside) according to Directive 1999/92/ EC.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
