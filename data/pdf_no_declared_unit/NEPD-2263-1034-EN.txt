Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN
15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production inhouse
is allocated equally among all products through mass allocation.
For almost all processes, detailed data are provided for each
process step, and the main allocation is between aluminium
hydroxide and aluminium oxide in the production of alumina.
Effects of primary production of recycled materials are allocated
to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling
process and transportation of the material is allocated to this
analysis.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The transport from production sites to market is assumed to be the weighted distance from the two smelters in Norway to a
location in central Europe, where 97% is transported to Rotterdam by ship and 3% are transported with truck. Of the 97%, 20% is
transported by train, 75% by barge, and the rest on truck.
Transport from production place to user (A4)
Type Capacity utilisation Type of vehicle Distance km Fuel/Energy
(incl. return) % consumption
Truck 50 Lorry, >32 metric tons, Euro V 585 2.46E-02 l/tkm
Boat 80 Cargo ship, 5000 tons 1129 1.56E-02 l/tkm
Barge 60 Freight, inland waterways, barge 230 1.13E-02 l/tkm
Train 50 Freight train 930 0.31 MJ/tkm
About 65% of the aluminium used for food and packaging purposes is collected and recycled (approximately 97% of
the collected aluminium), giving a total of 62,3% recycled. The rest is assumed incinerated with energy recovery.

Aluminium collected and recycled is assumed to replace an average extrusion ingot in Europe consisting of 40% recycled
and 60% primary aluminium. This is a conservative approach.
