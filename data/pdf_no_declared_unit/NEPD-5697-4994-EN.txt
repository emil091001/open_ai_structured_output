LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs FX45-P1519 0/100 3000 HF C2.5 MP/PC
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) can be excluded. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

The analysis is a cradle-to-grave study of one luminaire manufactured and installed, used according to a specific lighting regime over a specific
lifetime, including waste treatment at end-of-life.
A1-A5 includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, transport to the
market and assembly.
B6 is the operational energy use stage of the luminaire based on a scenario.
C1-C4 includes de-installation of the luminaire, average transport between building site and waste treatment facility, waste processing and
disposal. Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693.
D shows the recyclability of metals and plastics, and allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life.
The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by
the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4: Transport from manufacturing location in Wilkasy to warehouse in Jasin (448 km) + average distribution into the Europe market (300
km).
Module B6: The operational energy use of the luminaire is calculated based on the methodology provided in IBU PCR Part B for luminaires, lamps,
and components for luminaires. The energy consumption model for luminaire used in the PCR follows the application scenarios developed in EN
15193:2007. To calculate the electricity use of the luminaire, the following scenario parameters have been applied:
- User scenario = manufacture
- Active power of the luminaire (Pa) = 29 watt
- Passive power of the luminaire (Pp) = 0 watt
- Daylight time usage (tD) = 2250 hours
- Non-daylight time usage (tN) = 250 hours
- Standard year time (ty) = 8760 hours
- The occupancy depency factor (FO) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The daylight dependency factor (FD) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The product specific constant illuminance factor (FCP) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The non-daylight dimming factor (FN) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The application specific empiric lifetime of the luminaire in years (a) = 15 years (corresponding to the reference service life of the product)
Module C2: Average transport to Europe waste treatment facilities (300km).
Modules C3 and C4: Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D: The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

Remarks to environmental impacts
8 / 14
A luminaire is a product that consumes energy during the use phase. Combined with a relatively long expected lifetime and the environmental
impact of generating electricity, the use phase (B6) will normally be the most contributing stage to the overall environmental impact of the
declared unit. It is important to be aware that the actual calculations of the effect of B6 is particularly sensitive to which use scenario that is chosen
and which energy grid mix that is used.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
