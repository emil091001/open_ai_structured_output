3.5 CUT-OFF CRITERIA
Production phase (Modules A1-A3)
All input flows (e.g. raw materials, transportation, energy use, packaging, etc.) and output
flows (e.g. production waste) are considered in this LCA. The internal transport of the
products is not considered, because it falls under the cut-off criteria. The total neglected
input flows do not exceed the limit of 5% of energy use and mass.

construction waste, packaging waste, etc.), if applicable, are considered in this LCA. The
total neglected input flows do not exceed the limit of 5% of energy use and mass. For module A4, a capacity utilization of 90% has been taken to reflect reality.
Delivery of the luminaire throughout Europe is considered. Of the use phase, only module B6 (Operational Energy Use) is declared. The numbers for
this are calculated based on the formula given in the PCR. According to the PCR, the
operational energy use should be calculated based on the type of product (luminaire,
Use phase (Module B6) lamp, or lamp component). This product is a luminaire. The energy consumption of a
luminaire can be calculated with the following formula:
For the use phase, the input and output flows for Module B6 (operational energy use) are
considered in this LCA. The total neglected input flows do not exceed the limit of 5% of Energy consumption [kWh] = {Pa * FCP * FO * ( FD * tD + FN * tN) + Pp * ty} * 1/1000 * a

For the impact assessment, the characterization factors of the LCIA method EN 15804 +A2
Method v1.0 are used. Long-term emissions (>100 years) are not considered in the impact
assessment. The results of the impact assessment are only relative statements that do not
make any statements about end-points of the impact categories, exceedance of threshold
values, safety margins or risks. The following tables show the results of the indicators of the
impact assessment, of the use of resources as well as of waste and other output flows.

Disclaimer 1 – This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction
materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.

6 Interpretation of results
As can be seen in the graph, Module B6 (Operational energy use) has the biggest influence
in all environmental impact categories. After that, Module A1 (Raw material preparation)
has the biggest influence in most of the categories. In the category Resource use -
minerals and metals (ADP-mm), Module D (Benefits and loads beyond the system
boundary) has the biggest influence after Module B6.
