amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Machines and facilities (capital goods) required for and during the
production are excluded, as is transportation of employees.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
Plant manufacturing data is collected for 2019. Raw materials, transport and production volumes are also for 2019.

System boundary:
All processes from raw material extraction to product transport to the construction site and assembly are included in the analysis as well as end of life stage
and phases beyond the system boundary (A1 - A5, C1-C4, D). The basic production process comprises mixing of raw materials together. Raw materials are
cement, aggregate, filler and additives delivered as bulk, big bags or smaller bags from EU. Ready mixed product then packed to small bags, big bags or in
silos for bulk deliveries. Floor screeds are also delivered as bulk, where only water is added to pump truck silo being ready for the installation.
Floor screed doesn't require any maintenance during the use stage, so stage B is not considered. When building is demolished at the end-of-life floor
structure with floor screed integrated into concrete slab are crushed. 90 % of crushed concrete is recycled and used to replace natural gravel in soil
construction, remaining 10% being disposed into landfill.
System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below.
Additional technical information:
The LCA calculation has been made taking into account the fact that during the manufacturing process it is used 100% renewable electricity. This 100%
renewable electricity bought is evidenced by Guarantee of Origin certificates(GOs) from LOS, valid for the period chosen in the calculation (2019).

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Transport distance to the construction site (A4) is estimated to be 90 km from the manufacturing site (Kiikala – Helsinki). It is assumed that all the demolition
waste is collected and 90% of crushed concrete is recycled and 10% is disposed into landfill. Transport distance to processing is estimated to be < 30 km.
