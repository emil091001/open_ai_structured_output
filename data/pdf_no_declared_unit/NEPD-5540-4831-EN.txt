Product
Product description:
Pretecs wall ties is used to connect the outer layer of masonry to the inner layer of concrete in double walls and thereby transferring loads caused
by wind and temperature. The product consist of a bend wire of stainless steel, where the bend shape enables a solid anchorage in the masonry
mortar and concrete.
Product specification
Pretec wall ties is produced and CE-marked in accordance with EN 845-1.
The declaration of performance (DoP) is available on Pretecs web page.
The product can be delivered in several different sizes/shapes, see product data sheet for details.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
