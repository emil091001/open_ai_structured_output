6. LCA: Interpretation
The dominance analysis shows that the main causes Illustration: Dominance analysis A1
of environmental impacts and indicators can be found
in the information module A1. This shows the global Considering the material supply for the reaction resin
warming potential for the provision of material with mixture in detail, it becomes clear that two raw
about 90%, based on all information modules. materials of the reaction resin mixture contribute
decisively to the respective environmental effects and
indicators. The material supply of the polyester resin
generates about 76% of the greenhouse gas
emissions. For cement, it is about 13% greenhouse
gas emissions. With aluminum oxide, it is particularly
striking that almost 100% of the ODP is produced.
Illustration: Dominance analysis A1- A3
In the information module A1, the material supply of
the reaction resin mixture causes about 84% of the
global warming potential. Approx. 6% of the
greenhouse gas emissions occur with PA6
(packaging). Despite its low mass, aluminum
(packaging) has a share of about 5% in AP.
Illustration: Dominance analysis A1, reaction resin
mixture
The mass of the individual components of the reaction
resin mixture come from the recipe information
provided by the manufacturer. According to the
manufacturer, this information can be assumed to be
highly accurate.
The relevant datasets used to calculate the material
availability of the product are highly topical (DE:
polyester resin: /Sphera/, year: 2018, EU-28: cement:
source: /Sphera/, year: 2018).
Since these datasets strongly influence the results, as
shown by the dominance analysis, so does the overall
computation.
