Product
Product description:
The Siroc® sound joint is designed to create a separation joint in concrete slabs on the ground to prevent sound transmission through the
concrete slab. It is primarily used in apartments, townhouses, detached houses, industrial buildings, etc.
This LCA is based on the Siroc sound joint with a height of 400mm, but can also be used for other heights with the conversion factor found under
System boundaries.
Product specification
Siroc® elements is the original during the last 40 years on
the market both in terms of innovation and quality. Siroc®
elements provide a well-insulated and strong foundation. Is
available in several different designs.

Technical data:
The Siroc® sound joint consists of a fiber cement board enclosed by 9 mm soundabsorbing polyethylene on both sides. The calculated impact
sound level when using Siroc® sound joint meets the requirements for sound class A in Sweden. The sound joint also meets the requirements for
airborne sound insulation through the slab for sound class A. NOTE! This applies under the condition that the remaining construction and
transmission paths meet the requirements for sound class A.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

1. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the
indicator
2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
