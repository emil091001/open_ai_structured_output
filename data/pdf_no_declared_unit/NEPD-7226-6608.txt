Product
Product description:
Flexit Nordic CL2 RER (art. 800210) air handling units have been developed to be energy efficient in Nordic climate. Connection option for kitchen
hood via bypass. The unit has high-efficiency rotary heat exchangers, with a temperature efficiency of up to 85%. Low building height makes the
unit excellent for ceiling mounting or mounting in cold attic. All Nordic units are controlled as standard via the Flexit GO app and can be
supplemented with various accessories, eg. control panel, humidity sensor, pressure sensor for kitchen hood, CO2 sensor etc. The control system is
prepared for local demand control. Cooling recovery is a standard feature in the Nordic series. With Flexit GO you can also activate the function
free/night cooling. At high humidity, the defrost function ensures operation in cold climates.Can be installed both in cold attics and in suspended
ceilings
- Low weight and height < 30 cm
- Built-in humidity sensor
- Configurable door solution
- Very quiet, below 35 dB(A) 10m2 Sabine
- Control via app and cloud services

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A2: The transport methods used then there were no available data from the suppliers, were assumed to be:
Sweden, Finland and Norway - Class EURO 6 trucks
Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan - Class EURO 4 trucks
Remaining countries - Class EURO 5 trucks
Distances with seagoing vessels - Ship, Freight, Transoceanic (km)
A3: The energy used in manufacturing were calculated by: the total yearly energy consumption (kWh) divided by the total yearly production of air
handling units (kg).
A4: For the Nordic market, the default average travel distance from the manufacturing site to the building site is 300 km provided in NPCR 030
Part B for ventilation components.
C2: The average distance used from the deconstruction site to the waste processing facility is 85 km for the Norwegian market.
