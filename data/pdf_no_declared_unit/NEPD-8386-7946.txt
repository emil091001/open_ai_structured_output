Product
Product description:
bARK Module (non-glazed) is a versatile, pre-fabricated façade system made from high-quality Swedish glulam wood, combined with stone wool
insulation. The bARK Module (non-glazed version) system allows for extensive design flexibility, offering options for size, integrated spandrel glass,
metal or wood fillers. As well as various ventilated exterior cladding choices, including wood panels, stone, ceramic or metal elements.
The insulated sections, as detailed in this declaration, are compossed of a vapor barrier on the interior, stone wool insulation and exterior wind
protection. Installation is completed using steel fittings, tailored to the building's structural needs.
U-values typically range from 0.2- to 0.25 W/m²·K (for non-glazed modules).

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs bARK Timber Façade System (Non-glazed Module)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = Transport from our factory in Hultsfred to the construction site. Generic distance of 280 km.
Module C1 = includes use of energy for de-construction activities for the different material groups used in the system. C1 thus allocates energy
usage to sorting and demolition activities before each material group undergoes its respective waste treatment processes for the year 2021 as
defined by Statistikkbanken (SSB 2021), Table 09781: Treatment of waste from construction, rehabilitation and demolition of buildings (tonnes), by
material, contents, year and treatment.
Module C2 = A default transport distance of 85 km is recommended for the Swedish market.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in Statistikbanken (SSB 2021), Table 09781: Treatment
of waste from construction, rehabilitation and demolition of buildings (tonnes), by material, contents, year and treatment. This table specified how
different types of raw materials used in A1 will likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material
recycling and incineration with energy recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.
