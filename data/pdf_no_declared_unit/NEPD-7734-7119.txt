Product
Product description:
The RH Mereo series offers a range of ergonomic office chairs designed to suit individuals of all sizes and shapes, making them ideal for personal
use as well as shared office environments. Each model in the series is highly adjustable, with user-friendly levers and intuitive controls that allow
users to easily customize the chair to their personal preferences.
The RH Mereo 220 features a large, curved backrest that provides excellent support, while the RH Mereo 300 offers a large, square backrest for
those who prefer a different shape. Both models come standard with castors for soft floors and a durable black lacquered aluminium base, though
they can also be customized with a silver base or other optional accessories to fit various workspace aesthetics.
For users who prefer a more compact design, the RH Mereo 200 has a medium backrest that offers the same level of comfort and adjustability.
Like the other models in the series, it features the same high-quality build, intuitive controls, and options for customization, including black or
silver base finishes and black or light grey plastic details.
All RH Mereo chairs are designed to ensure a comfortable seating experience, promoting both productivity and well-being, while offering flexibility
to adapt to any office environment.
Product specification
The model studied in this declaration is the RH Mereo 220 (8212), including packaging. The model declared does not include any options such as

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs RH Mereo
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
