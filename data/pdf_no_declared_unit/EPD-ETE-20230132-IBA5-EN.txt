Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources”,
“water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”,
“potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”,
“potential soil quality index”. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these
results are high as there is limited experience with the indicator.
6. LCA: Interpretation
For WINDPANEL Standard and WINDPANEL Premium, the raw impact. With respect to manufacturing, it is the energy
materials used in the formulation mix together with the consumption from electricity and steam that contributes the
manufacturing and the transport to installation have the highest most. The transport to installation is significant as the transport
contribution on all impact categories. Cement and hydrated lime from China to Europe has been taken into account.
are the most important raw materials in terms of environmental
