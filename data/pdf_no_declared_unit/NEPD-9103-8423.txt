Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included when specific information are missing. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and
substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
3 / 12
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Module A1 includes the production of raw materials and energy used in the manufacturing of the plywood products. Popular logs are sourced
from China and Eucalyptus is sourced from Uruguay according to mill locations.
Module A2 comprises of transportation processes up to the plywood mill gates. Most of the materials are shipped to the mills by road and few
materials are also shipped by sea.
Module A3 includes the direct emissions of the manufacturing processes at the plywood mills, production of auxiliary and packaging materials,
treatment of solid wastes and pre-treatment of wastewater. Plywood manufacturing process is depicted in Figure 1.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
