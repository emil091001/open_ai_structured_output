Product
Product description:
StoArmat Classic AimS® is an organic, cement-free reinforcing compound/base coat. It is composed of a polymer-dispersion binder derived from a
combination of fossil and renewable natural sources, along with mineral fillers like marble granulate, water, and small quantities of additives and
pigments.
StoArmat Classic AimS® can be used as a thin-layered reinforcing compound or base coat for selected façade systems (e.g. StoTherm Classic®
and StoVentec R) and render systems (e.g. StoRend). It also excels as a levelling filler or as a renovation filler on mineral and organic substrates on
walls, ceilings and pillars in exterior. The application process can be done by machine or manually, using a rust-free steel trowel.
StoArmat Classic AimS® has the following properties:
-base coat in accordance with EN 15824
-reaction to fire: class A2-s1, d0 in accordance with EN 13501-1, non-combustible
-cement-free
-ready-to-use
-resistant to cracking and mechanical stress
For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of
Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies. The product needs a declaration of performance taking into consideration EN
15824:2017 title and the CE-marking. For the application and use the respective national provisions apply.

Reference service life, product
The service life of StoArmat Classic AimS® is 40 years in accordance with the BBSR table "Service lives of components for life cycle assessment
according to BNB in exterior application. Experience shows that if used as intended and installed correctly, the working life of reinforcing compound
is 50 years and longer.
A reference service life (RSL) in accordance with ISO 15686​-1,-​2,-​7, and ​-8 is not declared.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg StoArmat Classic AimS®
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Modules A1-A3
The raw materials are produced by and transported from suppliers located in Europe. The raw materials are filled in weighting containers and
thereafter mixed together. Quality control checks the consistency of the product and adjusts if necessary. The finished product is filled into pails
and stored. The product is transported on pallets and delivered to the customer.
A4 (Transport to market/building site): Since the distance to the construction site can vary strongly, a distance of 100 km is used to allow simple
scaling for individual projects.
A5 (Installation): The product is applied according to the specification on the technical data sheet at the construction site. Installation is generally
done manually. Outputs are small amounts of waste from the product itself (assumed to be a maximum of 3 %) and waste from packaging
materials.
C1 (De-construction, demolition): It is assumed that StoArmat Classic AimS® is dismantled using machinery.
C2 (Transport end of life): This stage includes the transportation effects of demolished waste to a waste processing area. The distance between the
demolishing area and a waste processing area is assumed to be quite short (less than 100 km). The distance varies depending on the type of
waste processing.
C3, C4 (Waste processing): Reinforcing compound is not classified as hazardous waste and treated as mixed construction waste. A typical End of
life scenario for construction waste in Germany is a mix of recycling and landfill. Since a 100 % End-of-life scenario has to be declared according to
the PCR, it is assumed as 100 % landfill.
D (Environmental costs and benefits of recycling and reuse): Energy credit related to energy recovery from the incineration is included in module
D.
Stages not included:
Once installation is complete, no actions or technical operations are required during the use stage until the end of life stage. Stages B1-B7 are
therefore not declared.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
