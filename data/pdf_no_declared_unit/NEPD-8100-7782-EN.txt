Product
Product description:
The F-R60K fire damper is a fire protection device designed with compartmentalization to effectively prevent the spread of toxic gases, smoke, and
fire. Its versatile design makes it suitable for various applications, including residential buildings, industrial facilities, hospitals, and more.
Product specification
The F-R60K fire dampers are available in various options and sizes.
Specific EPD data is provided as a reference for the F-R60K-160-B230T model.
Correction factors for other sizes can be estimated using the table in the Technical Data section below.

Technical data:
Technical details can be found at the following link:
https://design.systemair.com.
To estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWPtot) correction factor for specific product size and type use the table below. For sizes not listed,
calculate the correction factor using the provided equation.
Each size has a specific correction factor. The correction factor is calculated by multiplying a coefficient by nominal diameter “DN” in millimeters and
adding a constant.
The equation for each type is as follows:
F-R60 factor = 0,0044703 * DN + 0,4683979
F-R60K factor = 0,00462805 * DN + 0,296794
This equation enables you to estimate GWPtot correction factor for sizes not listed in the table. By using "DN" for your desired product size, you
can calculate the GWPtot correction factor.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
