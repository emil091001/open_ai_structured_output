Comparability:
General information on verification of EPD from EPD tools: EPD of construction products may not be comparable if they not comply with
Independent verification of data, other environmental information and the EN 15804 and seen in a building context.
declaration according to ISO 14025:2010, § 8.1.3 and § 8.1.4. Individualthird party
verification of each EPD is not required when the EPD tool is i) integrated into the
company's environmental management system, ii) the procedures for use of the
EPD tool are approved by EPDNorway, and iii)the proccess is reviewed annualy.
See Appendix G of EPD-Norway's General Programme Instructions for further
information on EPD tools.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small amounts (less than 1%) are
not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all products
through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling process and
transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were collected for EPD
development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is
presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In A4, a transport distance of 1445 km from the Prysmian Group production site in Oulu to Prysmian Group's warehouse in Loesmoen was included. A distance of 300 km
was also added as additional transport to market.
Installation (A5) and removal (C1) is assumed to be done with other products such as piping systems and should be assessed at a contruction works level.
For B1-B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are assumed to be zero. In C2, a distance of 300 km has been added as average transport to
the Norwegian waste treatment facilities. In C3, datasets are developed for the recycling of metals and plastics and for the incinerations of plastic fractions (including
energy recovery and fly ash extraction). All other minor raw materials in the product are assumed to be incinerated. Net benefit of material recycling and energy recovery
are given in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
