The dominance analysis shows that the main causes
of environmental impacts and indicators can be found Considering the material supply for the reaction resin
in the information module A1. This shows the global mixture in detail, it becomes clear that two raw
warming potential for the provision of material with materials of the reaction resin mixture contribute
about 91%, based on all information modules. decisively to the respective environmental effects and
indicators. The material supply of the polyester resin
generates about 75% of the greenhouse gas
emissions. For cement, it is about 11% greenhouse
gas emissions. With aluminum oxide, it is particularly
striking that almost 100% of the ODP is produced.
Illustration: Dominance analysis A1- A3
In the information module A1, the material supply of
the reaction resin mixture causes about 85% of the
global warming potential. Approx. 6% of the
greenhouse gas emissions occur with PA6. Despite its
low mass, aluminum has a share of about 5% in AP.
Illustration: Dominance analysis A1, reaction resin
mixture
The mass of the individual components of the reaction
resin mixture come from the recipe information
provided by the manufacturer. According to the
manufacturer, this information can be assumed to be
highly accurate.
The relevant datasets used to calculate the material
availability of the product are highly topical (DE:
polyester resin: Thinkstep, year: 2018, EU-28: cement:
source: Thinkstep, year: 2018).
Since these datasets strongly influence the results, as
shown by the dominance analysis, so does the overall
