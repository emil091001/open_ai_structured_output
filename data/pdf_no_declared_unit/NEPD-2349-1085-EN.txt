Declared unit: System boundary:
1 kg of Hydro HyForge Aluminium for forging produced Cradle to gate with options. The following stages have been
according to certified Hydro Reduxa 4.0 route. The EPD declared: A1-A4, C2-C4 and D. Further specificed in flow sheet
also covers modules C2-C4 and D. below.
The Hydro HyForge Aluminium for forging is produced in
the Husnes smelter. The results are based on the Module D covers the potential benefits from recycling of Hydro
production volumes of 2017. HyForge Aluminium for forging after end of useful life. Module D
covers all necessary stages from C3 until the aluminium is back
on to the market and compares to the environmental performance
of an average market forge ingot. The module is further specified
under scenarios.

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of
EN 15804. Incoming energy, water and waste production
inhouse are allocated equally among all products through
mass allocation. For almost all processes, detailed data are
provided for each step, and the main allocation is done
between aluminium hydroxide and aluminium oxide in the
production of alumina. Effects of primary production of
recycled materials are allocated to the main product in
which the material was used. The recycling process and
transportation of the material are allocated to this analysis.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The transport from the Husnes production site to market first happens by boat to a location in cental Europe. Therefrom, the average
distance by truck is assumed to be 500km.
Transport from production place to user (A4)
Type Capacity utilisation Type of vehicle Distance km Fuel/Energy
(incl. return) % consumption
Truck 50 Lorry, >32 metric tons, Euro V 500 2.46 E-02 l/tkm
Boat 80 Cargo ship, 5000 tons 954 1.56 E-02 l/tkm
Most of the aluminium used in the automotive industry is collected (approximately 95%) and recycled (approximately 97% of the
collected aluminium), giving a total of 92% recycled. The rest is assumed landfilled.

Energy recovery kg 0.027*
To landfill kg 0.05**
*27 grams of the original 1 kg of aluminium is going to incineration. No loads or beneifts are attribuded to this flow.
**There will be a small portion of aluminium ending as uncollected. This is included under "To landfill" where no loads or benefits are included.

Truck 40 Lorry, >32 metric tons, Euro V 50 2.85 E-02 l/tkm
Aluminium from the shredder to waste handling site is assumed to be transported in an older medium-sized lorry with smaller
capacity utilization than in the production system.

Unit Value
Aluminium foundry alloy to recycling g 924
Aluminium collected and recycled is assumed to replace an average extrusion ingot in Europe consisting of 40% recycled and
60% primary aluminium. This is a conservative approach.
