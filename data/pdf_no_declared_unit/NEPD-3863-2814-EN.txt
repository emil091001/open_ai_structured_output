LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small amounts (less than 1%) are
not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all products
through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling process and
transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were collected for EPD
development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is
presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = An average distance between the factory and the market is considered.
Modules A5 = 2% product losses during installation are estimated by the company. No energy use for installation has been quantified since this operation is assumed to
be done with other products and should be assessed at a construction works level. Cable drums are reused and assumed under the cut-off criterion of 1%.
Modules B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B7 = Company data shows that no significant activities have been reported for use, maintenance, repair, replacement, refurbishment, and
water use. This reflects an absence of impacts during the 30 years reference service life of the cable in these modules.
Module B6 = The operational energy use of the cable is calculated based on the methodology described in PEP Ecopassport, Product Specific Rules (PSR) for wires, cables
and accessories, reference PSR-0001-ed3-EN-2015 10 16. The following parameters are used to calculate the electricity loss of the cable:
- Estimate service life = 30 years
- Number of conductors = 4 units
- Use rate = 100 percent (according to appendix 1 of the PSR)
- Linear conductor resistivity = 0,00184 Ohm per meter
- Current intensity = 1 Ampere
Module C1 = For both buildings and construction works, cables will be taken out as part of a larger demolition. The energy use for cable removal compared to other
heaver materials is assumed to be low. This module can therefore be included with zero impact.
Module C2 = An average distance between the market and the waste treatment facility is considered.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle assessments of electronic and
electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product.
Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of
different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life. The benefits from
recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of
plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
