Product
Product description:
This EPD represents several similar products with <10% variation in A1-A3 GWP-total and is based on a representative product. Products included
are weber ML 5 colored Masonry Mortar Viipus 156, weber ML 5 colored Masonry Mortar Tumma Pellava, and weber ML 5 T colored Tight
Masonry Mortar Viipus 156 produced in Kiikala plant.
weber ML 5 is masonry mortar for clay bricks and calcium silicate masonry units. It is used in masonry of clay and calcium silicate masonry units in
facades and partition walls, masonry in the cold attic space and so-called cold flue section in the upper part of the chimney, as well as masonry of
a separate shell of the fireplace. weber ML 5 T is compact masonry mortar developed for masonry of clay and calcium silicate masonry units in
facades exposed to strong slanting rain, e.g. sites located on banks and shore lines, in open places or where higher than usual protection against
weather stress is desired for the structure. Both products come in a variety of colors when the joint's color is to be equivalent to the masonry unit.
Delivered in 1000 kg bags. GTIN: 6415990440851, 6415990124003, 6415910030049, 64159100463616.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg weber ML 5 colored Masonry Mortar Viipus and Tumma Pellava, weber ML 5 T Tight Masonry Mortar Viipus
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw materials extraction to product transportation to the building site, assembly as well as end of life stage and phases beyond
the system boundary (A1-A5, C1-C4, D) are included in the analysis.
The basic production process is similar in all production sites. It comprises of mixing raw materials together. Ready mixed product is then packed
into bags for delivery. Most representative packaging is selected for the LCA. At assembly phase, water is added according to the instructions and
it is mixed. Stage B is not considered. When building is de-constructed at the end-of-life, the structure with mortar integrated into it is crushed.
90% of crushed material is recycled and used to replace natural gravel in soil construction, remaining 10% being disposed to landfill. System
boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below.
Variation of core environmental indicators of specific products compared to the representative results reported in this EPD in A1-A3: GWPtotal 1%,
GWPfossil 1% to 2%, GWPbiogenic -25% to 0%, GWPluluc 3% to 6079%, ODP 1% to 4%, AP -4% to -2%, EPfreshwater 5% to 6%, EPmarine -22%
to -13%, EPterrestial -7% to -4%, POCP -5% to -4%, ADPminerals -6% to 4%, ADPfossil -1% to 0% and WDP -68% to -67%.
Additional technical information:
The LCA calculation has been made taking into account the fact that during the manufacturing process 100% renewable electricity is used. This
100% renewable electricity bought is evidenced by Guarantee of Origin certificates (GOs) from LOS, valid for the study year (2022) and after.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The results of stage A4 (transportation of product) in the table of this EPD refer to transportation in Finland from the plant (average distance
2022). This product may also be delivered to the countries in the table "Additional A4 information". In order to adapt the impact of transportation
to these countries, A4 figures from this EPD shall be multiplied by the multiplication factors below.
At installation stage, it is assumed that mixing is done by electric mixer. Electricity mix used is that of Finland. Material loss is considered to be 5%.
At end of life stage, it is assumed that all demolition waste is collected and 90% of crushed building material is recycled and 10% is disposed into
landfill. Transport distance to processing is estimated to be 30 km.
