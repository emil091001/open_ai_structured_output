Product description:
Compact dimensions – ideal for restricted spaces.
Small circular fire damper for shutting off air ducts between 2 fire compartments,available in 10 nominal sizes.
For more informations see: https://www.trox.de/en/fire-dampers/fkrs-eu-e44c04db778f79a6
Product specification
Circular fire damper that meets the requirements of the European product standard EN 15650. Tested for fire resistance properties to EN 1366-2
(negative pressure of 300 Pa and 500 Pa), with CE marking.
With the Declaration of Performance (DoP), the fire damper manufacturer provides evidence of the respective installation conditions, such as in, on
and away from walls or ceilings, with the essential features such as size, supporting structure, type of construction and installation and the
respective associated performance classes according to classification standard DIN EN 13501-3.
The ready-to-use unit contains a release device and a replaceable, fire-resistant damper blade that can be arranged with installation position 0 -
360 degrees depending on the use. Classification (depending on application):
EI 30 (ve, ho i <-> o) S to EI 120 (ve, ho i <-> o) S.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series FKRS-EU.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs FKRS-EU
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
