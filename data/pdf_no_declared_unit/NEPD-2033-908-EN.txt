Declared unit: Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804.
1 kg Fenomastic Ipek Mat Antibakteriyel, Jotun Boya San. ve Tic. A.S.
Incoming energy, water and waste production in-house is primarily
Cut-off criteria: allocated equally among all products through mass allocation. Specific
All major raw materials and essential energy is included. The production allocation was performed for certain waste flows according to information
process for raw materials and energy flows with very small amounts (less provided by the site manager. VOC emissions have been allocated
than 0.1 % dry matter) are not included. In total, more than 99% of the entirely to the production of solvent based paints. Effects of primary
material input is included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for non- production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
energy related emissions (such as wastes, hazardous materials and the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the
substances). material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
The CEPE database is used as basis for the raw material composition. Specific data for the product composition and raw material amounts has been
provided by the manufacturer and represents the production of the declared product. Production site data was collected in 2015. Representative data
from ecoinvent v3.2 was used for other processes. The data quality for the material input in A1 is presented in tabular form.
