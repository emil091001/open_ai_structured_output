2. Product
2.1 Product description
The geogrid is comprised of multiple hexagons formed by equilateral triangular apertures. These ap-
ertures are defined by a structure of monolithic, multidirectional tensile elements of defined orienta-
tion, size and shape.
The hexagonal geogrid is manufactured from an extruded polypropylene sheet, which is then punched
and orientated in three equilateral directions so that the resulting ribs of the triangular apertures have
a high degree of molecular orientation which continues through the mass of integral node.
2.2 Application
The intended use of the geogrid is to stabilize granular layers in order to minimize deformations during
trafficking, to improve the load bearing capacity and to increase the design life of the granular layer in
or under a construction in roads, railways and other trafficked areas, taking into account prevailing
national regulations on design methodologies. The stabilising geogrid is installed within or directly un-
der unbound granular layer to increase its stiffness. The combination of the geogrid and the aggregate
creates a mechanically stabilized composite layer with significantly improved properties and perfor-
mance capabilities in response to dynamic and static loading compared with aggregate layers alone.
When installing, the manufacturer’s installation procedures shall be observed, as well as the respective
national practices.

2.4 Placing on the market/ Application rules
For quality assurance the geogrids TriAx TX100 series are regulated in accordance with the European
Technical Assessment (ETA) 12/0530 and marked with a CE mark (or UKCA mark for the UK market) by
the manufacturer. In the EU/EFTA (excluding Switzerland) the placing of geogrids on the market is
Page | 3 Tensar International Limited – Tensar® TriAx® TX140
covered by Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 of 9 March 2011. For the product use the respective national
provisions shall apply. The product is packed and transported as roll and mainly marketed in Europe.
2.5 Base materials / Ancillary materials
TriAx geogrids are manufactured from a homopolymer or a copolymer of Polypropylene (PP). PP is a
thermoplastic polymer. It belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially crystalline and nonpolar.
PP is prepared by polymerisation of propene. It is rugged and unusually resistant to many chemical
solvents, bases and acids.
Raw material Unit Value
Polypropylene granules/pellets (PP) % 94
Masterbatch granules/pellets % 6
There is no biogenic carbon in the products.
The product is not included in the “Candidate list of substances of very high concern for authorisation”
(SVHC).
2.6 Manufacturing
The manufacturing is located at Tensar Manufacturing Limited, 2 Sett End Road West, Blackburn, Lan-
cashire, BB1 2PU, United Kingdom. The geogrids are made from PP granulate. In the first step granulate
is melted and then extruded. After this the extruded sheet passes the punching process. Depending
on the specific product the punches differ in size. The punched sheet is then stretched. The result is
the specific triangular structure of each geogrid. The products are rolled and then packaged.
The manufacturing process is shown in the following figure:
Figure 1: Process flow chart of the production of Tensar® TriAx®
2.7 Packaging
Geogrids are rolled and banded twice with PP banding tape.
2.8 Reference Service Life (RSL)
The RSL of the stabilisation geogrid depends on the service life of the roadway or platform it is included
in. This is dependent on both the exact roadway structure and the intensity of usage. The stabilisation
geogrids can be used in both temporary and permanent roadways and platforms. For temporary
Page | 4 Tensar International Limited – Tensar® TriAx® TX140
applications, service life would be measured using anticipated trafficking or imposed loading and
would typically last for time durations measured in days, weeks or months. For permanent roadways,
the stabilisation geogrids will be required to provide a service life of around 20 years. According to the
manufacturer the reference service lifetime of the TX100 series is in excess of 120 years.

Unit weight g/m2 175
Conversion factor to 1 kg - 5.71
3.2 System boundary
The Environmental Product Declaration is a complete life cycle with a functional unit. It considers all
potential environmental impacts of the product from the cradle to the end of life.
The manufacturing phase includes the production or extraction of the source materials, the transport
to the respective production plant and the production of the geogrids. All inputs (raw materials, pre-
cursors, energy and auxiliary materials) as well as the by-products and waste are considered for all life
cycle phases. Finally, only production-related energy consumption (excluding administration and social
rooms) is considered.
It is assumed that no activities for maintenance, repair, transport and replacement, refurbishment or
other material and energy flows take place during the useful life of 20 years (RSL). Modules B1 to B3
are therefore assumed to be zero. Product replacement (B4) and renovation (B5) only apply when the
product is considered in a lifespan (of a building, work, etc.). Operational water and energy use are not
considered.
The year 2020 represents the time reference for raw materials and electricity consumption. Due to the
production location United Kingdom is considered as the geographical reference area. Since the Dutch
NMD method has been applied, the product is also considered representative for Netherlands. How-
ever, environmental effects such as the greenhouse effect can occur with a strong spatial and temporal
offset.
The following production steps are considered during the manufacturing phase:
• Extraction and processing of the raw materials (PP, Masterbatch)
• Transport to the production site
• Processing of the geogrids (extrusion, punching, stretching)
• Packaging (including packaging material)
• End-of-life (including transport)
Secondary fuels are not included in the production process and are therefore not considered. The
waste materials and quantities produced are included in the respective modules.
3.3 Estimates and assumptions
Almost all datasets chosen for the LCA refer to the EU as the geographic reference. Transport dis-
tances for all raw materials used (raw materials, operating materials, packaging) could be recorded. A
payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal
transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific
truck was used.
Page | 6 Tensar International Limited – Tensar® TriAx® TX140
The distance to the construction site (A4) was calculated according to the NMD method. Accordingly,
the distance between the production site in Blackburn and Utrecht was considered (900 km). As the
mean of transportation truck (unspecified) was chosen.
Tensar International Limited switched in 2020 to a 100 % renewable wind energy. According to a wind
electricity portal, windbranche.de, 50% of wind power in UK is generated from onshore and 50% from
offshore wind parks. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calcu-
lation. No CO certificates were considered.

3.4 Cut-off criteria
All flows which influence the total mass, energy or environmental impact more than 1% are included
in the LCA. It can be assumed that the neglected processes would have contributed less than 5% to the
impact categories considered.
All process specific data could be determined and modelled by the use of generic data (EcoInvent 3.6)
The PP is bulk delivered in 24 tons batches – the pellets is blown into the silo. Therefore, there is no
packaging waste for the PP.
The masterbatch is delivered in octabins made of cardboard and a thin polythene liner. Cardboard and
liner are recycled afterwards. As the amounts for the masterbatch packaging are quite small referred
to the overall mass flow this packaging was neglected. It is assumed that the residues of the extrusion,
punching and stretching processes are less than 1% of the total mass, energy or environmental impact.
Therefore, these residues are within the cut-off criteria and were neglected.
3.5 Period under review
The production data applies to the operating year 2020.
3.6 Data quality
For all processes primary data was collected and provided by Tensar International Limited. The prima-
ry data refers to year 2020. For the data, which is not influenced by the manufacturer, generic data
was used. The secondary data was taken from the database EcoInvent (version 3.6). The database is
maintained on a regular basis and thus meets the requirements of EN 15804 (background data not
older than 10 years). The power sources were chosen from data for the UK in 2020, in accordance with
the geographical and time representativeness. The data quality is very good, because all process spe-
cific data could be documented and modelled by using the generic data.
RETHiNK EPD web application from the company NIBE was used to model the life cycle for the pro-
duction and disposal of the declared product systems. To ensure that the results are comparable, con-
sistent background data from the international database EcoInvent was used in the LCA (e.g. data rec-
ords on energy, transport, auxiliary materials and supplies). Almost all consistent data sets contained
in the EcoInvent database are documented and can be viewed online.
3.7 Allocation
Allocations were avoided as far as possible. Tensar uses PP for several products as a raw material and
all PP residues, which occur during the manufacturing, are recycled. The residues are not mandatorily
used again for the product from which they originate. The recycled residues might be used for products
from another PP based series.
Page | 7 Tensar International Limited – Tensar® TriAx® TX140
For example: 5% residues of PP occur during the manufacturing of geogrid A. These 5% are recycled,
but due to operating conditions, it is possible that 4% is reused for geogrid A and 1% for geogrid B.
For this calculation it was assumed, that the generated punchout and the regrind material of a specific
geogrid is reused in a closed loop recycling for the analysed geogrid. This was done to avoid product
specific shifts of potential environmental impacts. It was also assumed that the recycled PP substitutes
virgin PP after a regranulation and that this does not imply any quality losses.
3.8 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or assessment of the environmental impacts of different products is only
possible if they have been prepared in accordance with EN 15804. For the evaluation of the
comparability, the following aspects have to be considered in particular: PCR used, functional or
declared unit, geographical reference, definition of the system boundary, declared modules, data
selection (primary or secondary data, background database, data quality), scenarios used for use and
disposal phases, and the life cycle inventory (data collection, calculation methods, allocations, validity
period). For further guidance see EN 15804+A2 (5.3 Comparability of EPD for construction products).

4. LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
When installing stabilising pavement optimisation geogrid, it is simply unrolled by hand on prepared
subgrade or capping layer. Apart from rolling out, no further installation measures are necessary,
which would otherwise be required during road construction. A reject or unused portion of 5% of the
pavement optimisation geogrid is assumed during the installation process.
For C1 the process and amount of the generic dataset ‘Polyester weefsel’ (EN: polyester fabric) out of
chapter 22.46 Grondwapening en grondscheiding (EN: 22.46 Soil reinforcement and soil separation) of
the program DuboCalc with database version NMD version 1.8 - 5.01.14052018. In this generic dataset
0.0013 hrs of the process Gr.mach.hydr. (gemiddeld) (EN: Hydraulic excavator (average)) are stated for
module C1 (demolition).
For the end-of-life the NMD szenario PE/PP soil reinforcement (geotextile and geogrid) was chosen.
This scenario assumes that 25% of the geogrid remains in the subground, 70% are incinerated and 5%
are recycled. In the scenario the original waste scenario for benefits from recycling "Polyethylene,
HDPE, granulate | production (EU)" were substituted by the "Polypropene, granulate".
Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD
Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km; vehicle:
truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, it is assumed that only fossil raw materials are substituted, con-
sidering the calorific values of the raw materials of the declared product and energy and thermal effi-
ciencies of 18% and 32%. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits
are credited in module D.
For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative
assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different
lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is
calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6).
5. LCA: Results
The following tables show the results of the impact assessment indicators, resource use, waste and
other output streams. The results presented here refer to the declared specific product.
Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IR: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing radi-
ation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.

6. LCA: Interpretation
As shown in the figure below, raw material supply (A1) dominates in most environmental core
indicators, often followed by the production process (A3). In some environmental core indicators
demolition phase (C1) has a great impact. However, C1 is strongly dependent on the assumption (here
diesel consumption of a construction site vehicle). The highest influence on the Global Warming
Potential have row material supply (A1), waste processing (C3), and production process (A3).
Transports (A2, A4, C2) have rather a minor impact within all core indicators.

tors
The MKI (Dutch: Milieukostenindicator) value calculated based on set 1 of the NMD determination
method amounts to 0.055.
The data quality can be classified as good overall. All relevant process-specific data could be collected
in the operational data collection. Consistent data sets from the EcoInvent database were available for
almost all inputs and outputs. The background data meet the requirements of EN 15804, and the pro-
duction data were recorded for the 2020 operating year. The quantities of raw materials and supplies
used as well as energy consumption were recorded for the entire operating year.

7. Requisite evidence
In 2008 Tensar® TriAx® TX160 was tested concerning its leaching behaviour using the trough method.
Due to this method the institute “PrüftechnikCDL” could determine the direct environmental impacts
to the local environment (soil and groundwater). No parameters from the German Federal Soil Protec-
tion and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (BundesBodenschutz-und Altlastenverordnung: BBodSchV)
were found in the 5. eluate, except from phenol. The analysed phenol concentrations are with 12 µg
below the threshold value of the BBodSchV. In accordance with the criteria of the BBodSchVthe envi-
ronmental soundness of the geogrid could be confirmed. This result can be transferred to all the other
types of geogrids referring to the product series TX100, so as well to TriAx® TX140.
