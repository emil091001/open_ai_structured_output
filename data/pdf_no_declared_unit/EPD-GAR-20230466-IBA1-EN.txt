Technical construction data
Explanation of aluminium (Al) as a material:
Aluminium is a silver-white light metal with a melting point of
660 °C.
Aluminium is covered by a natural, thin oxide layer and is
therefore protected from decomposition by air, water or certain
chemicals. This makes the material highly corrosion-resistant
and durable.
The properties of aluminium also make it possible to produce
profiles with complex shapes and contours. In addition,

profiles used. In the biogenic climate change category, this
influence is more than compensated for by the storage of
carbon in the wood used for the packaging and the overall
result shows an environmental relief (negative). If the wooden
packaging is thermally utilised after use in module A5, the
resulting CO emissions must be included accordingly.

As other EPDs for aluminium products also show, the
environmental impact in module C is negligible compared to
A1–A3. The waste treatment by shredding shown at the end of
the product life cycle (module C3) only contributes very little to
the overall environmental impact of the products.
Due to the very good recyclability of aluminium, the material
can replace primary aluminium after recycling. Module D shows
the potential for recycling aluminium at the end of the product
life cycle. As a high proportion of secondary aluminium is
already used in the primary products of aluminium profiles, the
net flow into module D is reduced by these quantities. The
potential for substituting primary aluminium (credits) was
