Product:
Product description:
This is a product specific EPD for Isola Isosteel. Isosteel is a underlay for roof waterproofing for pitched roofs, new built and for rehabilitation.
Product specification
The product is made of natural bitumen free of tar, combined with thermoplastic elastomer, natural filler and polypropylene fleece on the surfaces.
Raw materials are mixed separately at a specific range of temperature and successively reinforced with polyester fleece, glass mat or a combination
of theese. The product has tacky edges to ensure a continuous water protecting layer, these edges are protected by siliconized PE, PP or PET films.​

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The product is installed by nails to wooden substrate without use of any energy that are influencing A5 The packaging is waste treated. Module
C1 is included but assumed to be zero, since the product is only a minor part of a total building demolition. The product is assumed to be
incinerated with energy recovery in C3. The benefit of substituting energy (heat and electricity) is included in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
