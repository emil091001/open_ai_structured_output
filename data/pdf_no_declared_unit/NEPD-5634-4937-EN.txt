Product description:
Splitter sound attenuator with high insertion loss, even in the high-frequency range.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/splitter-sound-attenuators/xs-c9d84f49040f2f3b
Product specification
Splitter sound attenuators used for the reduction of fan noise and air-regenerated noise in ventilation and air conditioning systems. Attenuation
effect due to absorption. Energy-saving as well as hygiene tested and certified. Splitter sound attenuator that consist of a duct with connections
and integral type XK splitters or a splitter set. Splitters consist of an aerodynamically formed frame (bullnose radius 20 mm) and absorbing
material. The splitter frame reduces pressure losses and air-regenerated noise. The profiled frame with bullnose edges increase the rigidity of the
splitter. Insertion loss and sound power level of air-regenerated noise measured according to EN ISO 7235. For requirements in areas with
potentially explosive atmospheres (ATEX), zones 1, 2, 21 and 22 (outside) according to Directive 1999/92/EC. The duct meets leakage class C and
pressure class 2 according to EN 15727.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs XS
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
