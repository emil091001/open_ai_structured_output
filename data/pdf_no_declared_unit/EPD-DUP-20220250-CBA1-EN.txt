Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”.
This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low-dose ionizingradiation on human health of the
nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or
radioactive waste disposal in undergroundfacilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, radon and from some
construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential
for fossil resources”, “water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential
comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”, “potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”, “potential soil quality index”.
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as theuncertainties on these results are
high as there is limited experienced with the indicator.
