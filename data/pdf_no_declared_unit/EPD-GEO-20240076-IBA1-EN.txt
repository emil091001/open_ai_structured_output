Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator 'Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235'. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator. Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators 'abiotic
depletion potential for non-fossil resources', 'abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources', 'water (user) deprivation potential,
deprivation-weighted water consumption', 'potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems', 'potential comparative toxic unit for humans
– cancerogenic', 'Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic', 'potential soil quality index'. The results of this
environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high as there is limited experience with
the indicator.
6. LCA: Interpretation
In the interpretation, the following representative impact
categories are selected for the considered product: GWP-total,
ODP, AP, EP-freshwater, POCP, ADP-mineral and metals
(ADPE) as well as ADP-fossil (ADPF). Module D is excluded in
the interpretation of share because it's outside the system
boundary.A1 has the largest share in almost all selected
categories: 'GWP-total' (96.1%), 'AP' (97.3%), 'POCP' (97.7%),
'ADPE' (99.6%) and 'ADPF' (95.1%), which means the
production of raw material (steel) is the main driver for these
impacts. In category 'ODP' and 'EP-freshwater' A3 has the
largest share due to the packaging materials.
This result is valid for suspension systems with different sizes
and shapes produced in Georg Kimmel GmbH. Due to the
same input and processes, it's considered to be no difference in
impacts per kg.
