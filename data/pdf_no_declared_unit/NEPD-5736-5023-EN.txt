Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below. eurobitume (2019) is not considered conservative according to EN 15804,
but is used due to common practice in other LCA tools, EPDs and PCR.
Specific environmental data from EPDs (Skanska EPD), in accordance with EN 15804, have been used for aggregates. Similarly, specific data have
been used for transport distances from supplier to asphalt plant and for all factory data (energy use, waste quantities, etc.). For all other data,
generic data available in the EPD tool have been used. Transport of reclaimed asphalt from the road to asphalt factory includes a return distance.
For bitumen, generic data from Eurobitume is used because specific data cannot be determined from the mix of bitumen suppliers according to EU
standards etc. used by Skanska. Environmental impact for reclaimed asphalt falls to previous product systems until arrival at the asphalt plant. The
asphalt plant uses electricity marked "Good Environmental Choice".

System boundary:
In accordance with EN 15804, the modules A1-A3, C, D are declared in this EPD. Modules A1-A3 represent a "cradle to gate" analysis for the
asphalt production, and Modules C and D are reviewing the end-of-life stage for the product and its reuse, recovery and recycling potential.
Declaration of the RSL is only possible if module B is included and is therefore not assessed in this study.
The flowchart below visualizes processes in the life cycle of the asphalt mass.
Additional technical information:
40% reclaimed asphalt is included.
