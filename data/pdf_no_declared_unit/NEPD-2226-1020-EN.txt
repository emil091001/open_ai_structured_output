Product description
Product description and description of use:
This EPD describes the potential environmental impacts of 1 m² of glass wool insulation,
ISOVER SC Floor Slab, with a thermal resistance equal to 1.00 m2K/W
The intended use of this EPD is to communicate scientifically based environmental information for
construction products, for the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of buildings.
ISOVER glass wool products are CE-labelled according to EN 14303 (2009) “Thermal Insulation
Products for Building Equipment and Industrial Installations. Factory made mineral wool (MW) Products.
Specification”, and EN 13172 (2012) “Thermal Insulation Products – Evaluation of Conformity”
The production site of Saint-Gobain Finland Oy / ISOVER in Forssa Finland, use a small amount of
natural and abundant raw materials (sand, soda, limestone, feldspar) and a high share of recycled glass
cullets (more than 70 % of external glass cullets). This material is converted by using fusion and
fiberizing techniques to produce glass wool. The products obtained come in the form of "mineral wool
slabs, rolls or lamellas" consisting of a soft, airy structure.
On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10 °C: its thermal conductivity factor,
expressed in λ, is 0.025 W/(mK) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral
wool is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0.030 W/(mK) for the most efficient, to 0.040 W/
(mK) to the least efficient.
With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best
insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact
noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises.
Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire.
Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort
and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls, floors, pipes
2
and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire.
Correctly installed glass wool products and solutions do not require maintenance and last throughout
the lifetime of the building (which is set at 60 years as a default value in the model), or as long as the
insulated building component is a part of the building.

Cut-off criteria
The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details:
- Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the value of all
flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available
- No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows
Data collected at the manufacturing site was used. The inventory process in this LCA includes all data related
to raw material, packaging material and consumable items, and the associated transport to the manufacturing
4
NEPD-226-1020-EN ISOVER SC Floor Slab
site. Process energy and water use, direct production waste and emissions to air and water are included.
Scenarios have been developed to account for downstream processes such as demolition and waste treatment
in accordance with the requirements of EN 15804:2012+A1:2013
All inputs and outputs to the manufacturing plants have been included and made transparent. All assumptions
regarding the materials and water balances have also been included.
All hazardous and toxic materials and substances are considered in the inventory even though they are below
the cut off criteria
There are excluded processes in the inventory:
- Flows related to human activities such as employee transport and administration activity.
Allocation
Allocation criteria are based on mass.
The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason we can
use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only
produce glass mineral wool in the Hyvinkää and Forssa sites using the same process and therefore all the
factors can be allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products and is accounted
for as well as if different surface layers are used.
A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we have not excluded any materials,
emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and
corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.

P roduct stage, A1- A3
Description of the stage:
The product stage of the mineral wool products is subdivided into 3 modules A1, A2 and A3
respectively “Raw material supply”, “transport” and “manufacturing”.
The aggregation of the modules A1, A2 and A3 is a possibility considered by the EN 15804
standard. This rule is applied in this EPD.
A1, Raw material supply
This module takes into account the extraction and processing of all raw materials and energy
which occur upstream to the studied manufacturing process.
Specifically, the raw material supply covers production of binder components and sourcing
(quarry) of raw materials for fiber production, e.g. sand and borax for glass wool. Besides these
raw materials, glass cullet is also used as input.
About cullet: The main raw material for the production of glass insulation material is cullets
or/and sand. Only specific cleaning activities and transport is included for the cullets – and thus
not the impacts from the full life cycle of glass. The reason is that cullets are considered a waste
product and not initially produced for the purpose of glass wool insulation production.
The only activities included are:
- Magnetic separation of metallic piece
- Separation of other piece-crushing of glass (<20 mm)
- Separation of bottle cap crushing (<2 mm) sieving
- Transport
A2, Transport to the manufacturer
The raw materials are transported to the manufacturing site. In our case, the modeling include:
road and boat transportations (specific values) of each raw material.
A3, Manufacturing
This module covers glass wool fabrication, including melting and fiberizing (see process flow
diagram). In addition, the production of packaging material is taking into account at this stage.

Manufacturing process flow diagram
C onstruction process stage, A4- A5
Description of the stage:
The construction process is divided into 2 modules: A4, transport to the building site and A5,
installation in the building.
Description of scenarios and additional technical information:
A4, Transport to the building site:
This module includes transport from the production gate to the building site.
Transport is calculated on the basis of a scenario with the parameters described in the following
table.
PARAMETER VALUE
Fuel type and consumption of vehicle or vehicle
Average truck trailer with a 27t payload, diesel
type used for transport e.g. long distance truck,
consumption 31,6 liters for 100 km

NEPD-226-1020-EN ISOVER SC Floor Slab
A5, Installation into the building:
This module includes:
- Wastage of products: 2 %. These losses are landfilled (landfill model for glass, see
chapter End-of-life)
- Additional production processes to compensate for the loss
- Processing of packaging wastes: they are 100 % collected and modeled as recovered
matter.
This module does not include:
- Energy for installation of the insulation, as the installation is done manually, and do not
require energy
PARAMETER VALUE
Wastage of materials on the building site before
waste processing, generated by the product’s 2 %*
installation (specified by type)
Packaging wastes are 100 % collected and modeled
Output materials (specified by type) as results of as recovered matter
waste processing at the building site e.g. of
collection for recycling, for energy recovering, Following a conservative methodology mineral wool
disposal (specified by route) losses are considered to be landfilled, while they are
100% recyclable and/or reusable.
Use stage (excluding potential savings), B1- B7
Description of the stage:
The use stage is divided into the following modules:
- B1: Use
- B2: Maintenance
- B3: Repair
- B4: Replacement
- B5: Refurbishment
- B6: Operational energy use
- B7: Operational water use
Description of scenarios and additional technical information:
Once installation is complete, no actions or technical operations are required during the use stages until
the end-of-life stage. Therefore glass wool insulation products have no impact (excluding potential
energy savings) on this stage.
End-of-life stage, C1- C4
Description of the stage:
The stage includes the following different modules of end-of-life:
C1, De-construction, demolition
The de-construction and/or dismantling of insulation products are part of the demolition of the
entire building, and are assumed to be made manually. In our case, the environmental impact is
assumed to be very small and can be neglected.
C2, Transport to waste processing
Transport is included and calculated on the basis of a scenario with the parameters described in
the End-of-life table below.
C3, Waste processing for reuse, recovery and/or recycling
Today the product is considered to be landfilled without reuse, recovery or recycling.
C4, Disposal

LCA results
LCA model, aggregation of data and potential environmental impact are calculated from the GaBi
software 8.7 and CML impact method has been used, together with thinkstep 8.7 (2018) and ecoinvent
V3.1 (2014) databases to obtain the inventory of generic data. Biogenic carbon is not reported in the
context of GWP.
Raw materials and energy consumption, as well as transport distances have been taken directly from
the manufacturing plant of Saint-Gobain Finland Oy / ISOVER in Forssa (Production data according
2018).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Influence of particular thicknesses
All the results in the table of this EPD refer to ISOVER SC Floor Slab with a thickness of 35 mm for a functional
unit of 1 m² with a thermal resistance equals to 1.00 m2K/W
This EPD of ISOVER SC Floor Slab includes a range of thicknesses between 35 mm and 50 mm. For every
thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. In order
to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1.00 m2K/W for 35 mm).
The various multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses, including
packaging.
In the table below the multiplication factors are shown for products and specific thickness of the product family. In
order to obtain the environmental performance associated with every specific product and thickness, the results
expressed in this EPD must be multiplied by its corresponding multiplication factor. Such factor is based on GWP
indicator and should be used as a proxy for the rest of indicator showed in this EPD. If there is a need for
environmental performance for a thickness not presented in the table below, please use a thickness just above it.
