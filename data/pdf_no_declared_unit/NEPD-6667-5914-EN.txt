Product
Product description:
Siroc® Concre Isoler-elements made for foundation on the ground, homes,
garages, industrial buildings.
This LCA is based on a standard Siroc® Isoler-element. It can be used for other thicknesses and heights with the conversion table found under
System boundaries.
Product specification
Siroc® Concrete Isoler-elements is the original during the last 40 years on
the market both in terms of innovation and quality. Siroc® Isoler-
elements provide a well-insulated and strong foundation. Is
available in several different designs, “Siroc® special”. The
outside of the element is coated with 10mm grey brushed concrete surface.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m SIROC BETONG ISOLER-ELEMENT
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
