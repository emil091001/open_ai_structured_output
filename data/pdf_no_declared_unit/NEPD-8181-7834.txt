Product
Product description:
The EPD describes results for production of lightweight expanded clay aggregate, labelled Leca® 4-10 (50-50), from the factory in Hinge,
Denmark.
Lightweight expanded clay aggregate is a granular ceramic material made from natural clay (see process information below). The main
characteristic of expanded clay is low density combined with high strength. Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is used primarily in lightweight blocks and slabs, in
water treatment, lightweight fillings and geotechnical fills for weightcompensation purposes. Thus Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is typically hidden in
buildings or cast into concrete. The density of Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is 0,275 tonnes per m3. Further information or explanatory material may be
obtained by contacting Leca Danmark A/S.
Product specification
The water content of the Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is 0 % when the Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is produced at Leca Danmark A/S Hinge. The storage
conditions can change the water content of the Leca® 4-10 (50-50) up to 25%.
Different waste are recovered in the production process both as fuels as clay additives. See additional Tech info.
Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is produced by using nearby clay and transported by using a conveyer belt to the factory.
Negligible amounts of packing material is used for raw materials and auxiliares received at Leca Danmark A/S so the potential environmental
impacts from packing is not included. Furthermore the final product Leca® 4-10 (50-50) is sold in bulk, so no packing is used.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
