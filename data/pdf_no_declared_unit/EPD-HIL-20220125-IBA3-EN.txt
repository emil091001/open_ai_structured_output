process Hilti HIT­RE 500 V4 is supplied in the form of a 2­foil­pack
system and thus leads to very little waste remaining after use

disposed of with household waste. Full or only partially emptied
cartridges must be disposed of as special waste in accordance
with official regulations.
The outer packaging consisting of plastic foil and cardboard
boxes designed according to the product size can be recycled.
Packaging contaminated by the product must be disposed of in
a safe manner in accordance with local/national regulations.
For this EPD, the declared packaging is a weighted meanvalue
of all available packaging sizes. This results in a 151 g of
packaging composed of 64 g of plastic, 84g of paper and
cardboard, 3 g of aluminium.

During the installation, the temperature of the base material
must be between ­5 °C and +40 °C . The temperature of the
product should be between +5 and +25 °C during storage and
+5 and 40 °C during usage. Hilti literature and official approvals
must always be considered. The two components of HIT­RE
500 V4 are only for use in combination with the defined volume
ratio and under these conditions mentioned above to build up a

Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low­dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non­fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources”,
“water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation­weighted water consumption”, “potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”,
“potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for humans ­ not cancerogenic”,
“potential soil quality index”. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these
results are high as there is limited experience with the indicator.
6. LCA: Interpretation
The dominance analysis shows that the main causes of more than 70% of the global warming potential.
environmental impacts and indicators can be found in the
information module A1. This shows the global warming potential
for the provision of material with about 70 %, based on all
information modules. Modules A3 and A5 also represent an
important part of the final impact.
