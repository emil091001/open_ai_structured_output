Product:
Product description:
Tyvek® FireCurb Soft is a lightweight, advanced, fire-retardant membrane that selfextinguishes when ignited. It uses a halogen-free flame-
retardant additives to reduce the formation of droplets and smoke with minimal environmental impact. Tyvek® FireCurb Soft ® takes the airtight
and watertight yet vapour-open breather membranes of Tyvek® membranes and adds flame retardancy properties that can significantly increase
building safety. Suitable for use in all building types, from bungalows to high-rises. For the placing on the market of the product in the European
Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies. The product
needs a declaration of performance taking into consideration EN 13859-2: Flexible sheets for water proofing – Part 2: Underlays for walls and the
CEmarking. For the application and use the respective national provisions apply.
Application:
The product is used on the cold side of building facades. It is placed in front or behind insulation and will improve water and wind tightness during
construction and the lifetime of the building.

Reference service life, product
The service life of membranes out of plastic or elastomers is 40 years according to BNB (http://www.nachhaltigesbauen.de/baustoff-
undgebaeudedaten/nutzungsdauern-von-bauteilen.html). Since the whole lifecycle of the product is not considered and for sake of compliance to
EN 15804+A2 (2019), the functional unit does not have to be declared. Instead, the declaration unit is 1 m2 of an envelope.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m2 Tyvek® FireCurb Soft
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​
Regarding background data, the Luxembourg and German electricity grid mix were applied to the production plants in these countries. Other
background data were specific to Germany or the European average and were not older than 10 years. A proxy was used for the main flame
retardant additive, as well as for the colour paste for finishing (generic waterbased colour paste composition). The representativeness can be
classified as very good for all the foreground data, and for most of the background data. The GaBi database (Sphera Solutions GmbH, 2022.1) was
used to model background data.

System boundary:
The system boundaries of the EPD follow the modular construction system as described by EN 15804. The LCA considers the following modules:
A1-A3: Manufacturing of pre-products, packaging, ancillary materials, transport to the factory and production, with the associated energy supply
and waste handling
A4: Transport to the construction site
A5: Installation into the building including disposal of packaging
C4: Waste disposal, namely incineration
D: Potential for reuse, recovery and/or recycling including benefits for product incineration from module C4
Additional technical information:
Base materials/Ancillary materials The product is made from HDPE (ca. 88 % of product weight) and is coated with fire-retardant additive and ink
(ca. 12 % of product weight). This product/article/at least one partial article contains substances listed in the candidate list (date: 16. Nov 2022)
exceeding 0.1 percentage by mass: no.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
