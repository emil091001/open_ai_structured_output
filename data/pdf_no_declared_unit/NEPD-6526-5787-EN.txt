Product
Product description:
Thermaline 440 (formerly Thermaline 400 EU) is a high performance, heat resistant modified epoxy phenolic that specializes in providing color for
uninsulated piping and equipment. This immersion-grade coating has excellent resistance to wet/dry cycling conditions at elevated temperatures
when using dry grind pigments. This formulation allows for use on hot steel substrates under insulation, operating continuously up to 400°F
(204°C). It has excellent chemical resistance properties to
handle the corrosive effects of wet insulation under thermal cycling conditions.
Product specification
• Versatile use from cryogenic temperatures of -320°F (-196°C) up to 400°F (204ºC) exposures
• Very good flexibility
• Excellent overall chemical resistance
• Very good abrasion resistance
• Easily applied by spray
• Acceptable for use over stainless steels
• Rapid Tint System Colors available*

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg THERMALINE 440
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
3 / 12
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
This EPD is prepared for declaring the production process (A1-A3) of 1 kg of packed ‘ready-to-use’ product. Transport to the client (A4) and end
life stage (C modules) and potential environmental benefits (D module) are also included.
Module A4 describes an average distance from the manufacturing site to where the product is being sold to the client.
This declaration covers end-of-life stage (C module) of a coated construction where dried/cured paint is not removed from the surface during
demolition.
Module C1 is declared as zero due to the negligible consumption of energy and natural resources for disassembling, since paint is a part of
another product that ends its life.
Module C2 is estimated for delivery of paint residues to the closest waste treatment facility and is assumed as 50 km.
Module C3 has a zero impact since dried paint is not recycled or reused.
Module C4 is declared for dried paint, after solvents’ evaporation.
Module D is declared for zero since drier or cured paint is non-recyclable nor reusable.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
