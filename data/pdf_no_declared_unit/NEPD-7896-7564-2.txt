Product
Product description
Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mixed
concrete is manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other
cementitious materials or chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality,
strength, and composition. This consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mixed concrete
is then delivered to the construction site in an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This
saves time in labour, equipment setup, and material handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced
according to BS 8500 and BS EN 206. Testing was conducted according to BS EN 12350 and BS EN 12390. Performance data
of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the relevant technical provision (no CE-marking).

The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a
necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of
naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste.
To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength,
chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped,
put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

Formwork and Falsework each contribute less than 1% of the total product CO2 emissions, and are therefore neglected
under cut-off rules. (Kaethner, Burridge, 2012). Other sources: Concrete waste: Adams & Hobbs (2023). Electricity, Diesel:
