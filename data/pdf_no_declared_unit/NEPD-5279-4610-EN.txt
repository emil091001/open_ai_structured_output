LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Harmonie "Kompakt" interior door without glass
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The PCR specific
background data follow the allocation rules in the Ecoinvent v3.7.1 Cut-off database version. The allocation of water, energy and waste flows
within the production facilities for windows and doors follows unit-based allocation adjusted with a point system to different product groups or
products. This score system is regulated by a factor which increases with the resource intensity of each product. The unit-based allocation is
adjusted by the weight of the product, excluding the weight of glass.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
For the products with different sizes from the declared unit, the environmental impacts must be converted by using a conversion factor. The
Norwegian EPD Foundation has published instructions on how to interpret EPDs for Windows on its website (www.epdnorge.no) where different
calculation methods have been stated. (Document: Bruksanvisninger i hvordan tolke EPD'er - Vinduer).

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A4- Transport
Based on information from the manufacturer, the transportation scenario for the final packed product from the manufacturer to the construction
site is as the following: from the factory in Romania to the warehouse in Stokke, Norway: 452 km by Euro 6- medium truck, 1376 km by train, 99
km by boat, and 568 km by Euro 6- medium truck.
The average transportation distance from the warehouse to the installation site is assumed 50 km by medium truck.
A5- Assembly
According to the report from EPD-Norge Harmonising the documentation of scenarios beyond cradle to gate, EN 15804 there is no loss on-site
during construction activities. Since painting and surface treatment are done before installation, installation materials are negligible and not
included in this assessment. Energy consumption during installation can be varied depending on the floor, type of building, and several other
unknown parameters, and therefore ignored in the calculation. So, the installation module includes waste treatment of packaging waste.
The contribution from auxiliary materials used for installation, e.g., fixings, sealants, and insulation materials, is commonly considered to be within
the cut-off criteria (6.3.4.3 Construction stage, NS-EN 17213:2020).
B1- Use
Use of the installed product in terms of any emissions to the environment (not covered by B2-B7). Module not declared.
B2- Maintenance
The maintenance scenario includes cleaning and painting. Cleaning is performed two times washing per year for doors without glass. It is
calculated with 45 ml of detergent and 4.5 liters of water each year during RSL of the building.
Doors are assumed to be painted 1 time during their lifetime. It is assumed that 5 gr of lubricating oil is used every year for fittings and moving
parts.
B3- Repair
No repair is assumed during the product’s lifetime. Module not declared.
B4- Replacement
The door has an RSL (Reference Service Life) of 10 years. If the lifetime of the building is assumed 60 years, a five-time replacement.
B5- Refurbishment
There is no need for refurbishment during the product’s lifetime. Module not declared.
B6 and B7
Module not declared.
C1- Deconstruction demolition
In the C module, the end-of-life scenario is assumed that the door is demounted during the deconstruction process and no separate energy from
a machine is required for this process.
C2-Transport
The entire door is transported to a municipal waste collection and sorting station, and the average transport distance from the demolition place to
the station is assumed to be 85 km.
C3- Waste processing
Based on Table 1 in NPCR 014 Part B- Windows and Doors, the door is assumed as mixed waste and sent to municipal incineration with energy
recovery.
C4- Disposal
The ashes from municipal incineration, that are not separated for recycling goals, are transferred to landfilling.
D- Benefits and loads beyond the system boundaries
The combustible materials (plastic and timber) are considered as energy recovered materials. Energy recovery from incineration is assumed with
the process efficiency rate of the power station above 60 %.
The metals are separated from the bottom ashes and recycled. Since there is no data on the share recycled, the Ecoinvent database is employed
(B.3, NS-EN 17213:2020) Here the assumption is that recovered metals can be substituted by the primary metals used (6.4.3.3, EN 15804).

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
