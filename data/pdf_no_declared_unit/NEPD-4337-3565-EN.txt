Product
Product description:
PAROC® stone wool insulation in naturally non-combustible and durable. It is made of natural
stone (~98%) and air (~2%). As stone wools thermal performance is based on static air,
insulation products keep their energy saving abilities and dimensions in different temperature
and moisture conditions during the life cycle of a building.
The products covered by this declaration are PAROC stone wool thermal insulation products
manufactured in Trzemeszno, Poland using low carbon melting technology, based on an electric
melter with renewable electricity.
Product specification:
The average composition used for this EPD is calculated based on line consumption figures for
raw materials. The raw materials are mainly natural stones and resin binder.
Materials %
Stone Wool Fiber >95
Binder (phenol-formaldehyde-urea-copolymer) <5
Dustbinding (mineral oil) <1
Technical data:
For the products covered by this EPD, the performance data are in accordance with the
declaration of performance with respect to its essential characteristics according to EN
13162:2012+A1:2015, "Thermal insulation products for buildings – Factory made mineral wool
(MW) products – Specification."
- Thermal conductivity: 0,033-0,040 W/mK, EN 12939 and EN 12667
- Fire class: A1, EN 13501-1:2007+A1:2009
Complete technical specifications can be found on www.paroc.com
Market:
This EPD is intended for the markets that receives PAROC building insulation products from the
factory in Trzemeszno, Poland. Those markets are mainly Poland, Germany, Austria, Czech
Republic and Slovakia.
Reference service life, product:
The reference service life of PAROC products is equal to the reference service life of the
building. For the purpose of this EPD the reference service life if considered to be minimum 60
years, which is usually the assumption about the lifetime of the building where this is installed.
Reference service life, building:
The reference service life of a building is set to 60 years in this EPD.
EPD for the best environmental decision 3
LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
The declared unit refers to 1 m2 of PAROC Solid with a thermal resistance (R) of 1 m2K/W,
thickness of 37 mm and weight of 0,999 kg.
The specific product, PAROC Solid, is a stone wool slab with a density of 27 kg/m3 and thickness
of 100 mm.
The impact indicators for another product can be calculated by multiplying the results of the
EPD with the respective scaling factor for the products covered by this EPD. A table with the
products available in the scaling table and their respective scaling factors is provided within the
‘Additional technical information’ section.
Data quality:
All primary data are collected line specific, based on the financial year 2021. The production
data from Trzemeszno involves production lines with an electric melter and renewable
electricity.
The background data has been taken from the latest available GaBi database (/GaBi TS) CUP
2022.2. The requiremens for data quality and background data correspond to the specificiations
of EN 15804+A2. The process data and the used background data are consistent.
The data quality can be qualified as good.
Allocation:
The allocation correspond to the specifications of EN 15804+A2. Allocation and other
methodological choices are made consistently throughout the model. As a worst-case approach,
price allocation is considered for the plant.
EPD for the best environmental decision 4
System boundary:
The system boundary of the EPD follows the modular structure defined by EN15804+A2. The
flowchart above represents the system boundaries for the product, construction process, end-
of-life and benefits (D). The use stage (B1-B7) relating to the building site is not included in this
study, as there are no activites and no significant environmental impact in the use stage.
Cut-off criteria:
All data from the production data acquisition has been considered, i. e. all basic materials used
per formulation, utilized thermal energy, internal fuel consumption and electric power
consumption, direct production waste, and all emission measurements available. All material
and energy flows, except paper for labels in packaging, with a proportion of less than 1% have
been considered. The neglected flow (paper label for packaging) does not exceed 1% of the
impact categories. Machines and facilities required during production are neglected.
The declared unit of stone wool is without any coating.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD. There are
no maintenance (B2), repair (B3), replacements (B4) or refurbishments (B5) required during
the use of PAROC stone wool thermal insulation products in standard conditions. They do not
require energy (B6) or water (B7) during their operational life. No significant emissions to the
indoor environment occur in module (B1). Therefore, modules B1-B7 are not relevant for this
EPD.

The installation in general takes place manually. Thus, machines or energy expenditures are not
taken into account. Most products are self-supporting and do not need support. Installation
losses have been accounted for 2% as a conservative approach. Within module A5 a site related
packaging waste processing is included in the LCA. It is assumed that packaging material as
leftover of the installed product is for 100% collected and incinerated.

Although mineral wool products from Paroc can be recycled, they are estimated as being 100%
landfilled after the use phase as the most conervative approach.

The distance representes an average distance to landfill, the stone wool is in general not
transported alone to landfill, therefore a load factor of 50% is considered in this case.
Benefits and loads beyond the system boundaries (D)
Benefits are considered in module D for the thermal and electrical energy, generated in module
A5, due to thermal treatment of packaging waste (polyethylene film and wooden pallets) after
installation.
Additional technical information
Below a list of products covered by this EPD and their scaling factors. The scaling factor can be
used to estimate the environmental performance indicators for the specific products of 1 m2
when R=1. The environmental performance solely refer to the stone wool, and thus do not
include the environmental performance of any potential coatings. Due to this fact, the variation
is less than 10% by reason of the density, lambda and binder. The scaling calculation shall be
done as follows:
