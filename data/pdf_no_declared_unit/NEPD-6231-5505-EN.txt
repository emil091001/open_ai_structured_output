Development and verification of EPD:
General information on verification of EPD from EPD tools: The declaration is created using EPD tool lca.tools ver EPD2022.03,
developed by LCA.no. The EPD tool is integrated in the company's
Independent verification of data, other environmental information
and the declaration according to ISO 14025:2010, § 8.1.3 and § 8.1.4. management system, and has been approved by EPD Norway.
Verification of each EPD is made according to EPD-Norway’s
Developer of EPD: Eva Brandt Larsen
guidelines for verification and approval requiring that tools are i)
integrated into the company's environmental management system, ii) Reviewer of company-specific input data and EPD: Anya Roskjær
the procedures for use of the EPD tool are approved by EPD-Norway, Knudsen ​
and iii) the process is reviewed annually by an independent third
party verifier. See Appendix G of EPD-Norway's General Programme

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m3 Readymix concrete C30/37 Moderate SCC. CEM I 52,5 N MS/LA - IBF Give
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
According to DS/EN 206 DK NA concrete produced according to exposure classes XC2, XC3, XC4, XF1 and XA1 can be used for:
Concrete exposed for long-term water contact (XC2), concrete inside buildings with moderate or high air humidity or external concrete sheltered
from rain (XC3), concrete surfaces subject to water contact not included in XC3 e.g. external walls, facades, balconies etc. (XC4), vertical concrete
surfaces exposed to rain and freezing (XF1), and concrete exposed to natural soil and ground water with slightly aggressive chemical environment
(XA1).

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
