Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

The analysis is a cradle-to-grave study made for 1 m of cable manufactured , installed and used indoors over the lifetime 30 years. Modules A1-A5
are included in the analysis. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the factory, the production process itself,
transportation to market and installation of the product. Modules B1-B7 describe the use phase and are not declared for an indoor cable. C1-C4,
D are mandatory modules which include end of life treatment of materials and the benefits from recycling.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = We have calculated the weighted average of distances to customers.
Modules A5 = 2 % product losses during installation are estimated by the company. No energy use has been quantified since installation in
buildings is often done by manual labour. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-
off criterion of 1%.
Module C1 = de-construction in buildings is often done by manual labour. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy
requirements falling under the cut-off criterion of 1%.
Module C2 = We have used an average distance of 85km for transport to disposal.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consists of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life.
The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by
incineration with energy recovery of plastics is also calculated in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
