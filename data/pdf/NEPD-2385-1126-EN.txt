Allocation of energy, water and waste from production is calculated according to EN 16485:2014. This is based on the modularity
by a physical allocation factor based on the manufacturer input. principle in EN 15804:2012 that specifies that the emissions

has FSC certified traceability.
LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD
An average distance of 300 km with truck is used within Norway. The transportation from production to construction site is based on a
scenario where the product is transported on a large lorry to a radius of 250 km to a warehouse. Transport from warehouse to a
construction site is assumed to be 50 km on a medium truck.

mixed waste and sent to incineration. The combustible materials are then energy recovered, while glass is assumed to end up in the
bottom ash and then landfilled. The metals are usually sorted out of the bottom ash and then recycled, but there is no data of the share
which are recycled and therefore standard values from Ecoinvent is utilized.

Global warming potential in A1-A3 includes sequestration of 26.4 kg CO2 as carbon in the wood. The same amount is accounted as
an emission in module C3. Additionally, it is included sequestration of 4.5 kg in the wood packaging. This is accounted as an
emission in module A5. The flow of biogenic carbon for the system is presented in page 9.

To increase the transparency of the climate impacts, the GWP indicator has been divided into sub-indicators:
GWP-IOBC Climate impacts calculated according to instant oxidation principle
GWP-BCIP Climate impacts calculated from the net impacts of sequestration and emission of biogenic carbon

Additional information
For the products with different sizes from the declared unit, the environmental impacts must be converted by using a conversion
factor. The Norwegian EPD Foundation has published instructions on how to interpret EPDs for windows on its website (www.epd-
norge.no) where different calculation methods have been stated. (Document: Bruksanvisninger i hvordan tolke EPD'er – Vinduer)
