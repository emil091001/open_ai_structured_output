Product
Product description:
ÖLFLEX CLASSIC 130 H are halogen free, highly flame retardant control cables designed for the European and North American market, for
occasional flexible use and fixed installation subject to normal mechanical load conditions.
They are also suitable for use in dry or damp areas. Considering the temperature range, a temporary outdoor use is possible. They are
suitable for occasional, non-automated movements. The maximum tensile load is 15 N/mm² of conductor cross-section during installation
and operation. Compulsory guidance is not permitted.
Application range: Public buildings, airports, railway stations, plant engineering and construction, air conditioning systems and particularly
where human and animal life as well as valuable property are exposed to high risk of fire hazards. In the event of a fire minimal toxic and no
corrosive gases occur.
USE according to UL: FRPE sheathed cable for internal wiring of appliances

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m ÖLFLEX CLASSIC 130 H 5G0,75 Elnr 1070920
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = In A4, a transport distance from the production site to LAPP Norways warehouse in Drammen was included. A distance of 300 km
was also added as additional transport to market.
Modules A5 = 5 % product losses during installation are estimated by the company. No energy use has been quantified since installation in
buildings is often done by manual labour. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut​off
criterion of 1%. Cable drums are reused and also assumed under the cut-off criterion of 1%.
Module C1 = de-construction in buildings is often done by manual labour. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy
requirements falling under the cut-off criterion of 1%.
Module C2 = 85 km is added as an average distance to the waste facility
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life.
The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by
the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
