3.5 Background data
The data on which the life cycle assessment is based
comes from data collection at the Oggaz plant.
Information on the use of material and energy
resources as well as transport distances was provided
by Lafarge Ciment Oggaz (LCO).
The emission data used in the life cycle assessment of
clinker production are based on the legally prescribed
emission measurements on rotary kilns of Lafarge
Ciment Oggaz (LCO) for the period 01/01/2021 to
31/12/2021. Gaps in kiln emission reporting were filled
with proxy data from generic clinker profiles of the
ecoinvent database.
The CarbonCLARITYTM EN 15804 EPD Generator –
Cement, version 1.2.0 dated 07/11/2022 with the
configuration file dated 21/01/2025 was used for the
life cycle assessment. The calculation used the
Ecoinvent database v3.8.
3.6 Data quality
The data basis for this EPD is the continuous data
acquisition in the Oggaz plant.
The data was collected for the calendar year
01/01/2021 to 31/12/2021 by Lafarge Ciment Oggaz
(LCO) and checked for plausibility by Climate Earth.
