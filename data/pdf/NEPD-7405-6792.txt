Product
Product description:
Haplast PE tanks are used as pressureless water reservoirs/water tanks, tanks in sedimentation or treatment plants, reservoirs for equalizing the
load for sewage systems and for other purposes where liquid is to be stored in buried tanks.
Product specification
Further information can be found at https://haplast.no/
This EPD applies only to the water tanks produced at Haplast, and does not include technical installations (pump, valve, ladder, filter, etc.).
Calculations for this EPD is done based on an average water tank with size:
- Di 2.500 mm
- L 10.000 mm
Project specific EPD can be delivered on request.

Profile type Description
VW This profile type is a homogeneous solid wall pipe with smooth inside and outside surfaces. Pipes can be used for internal working pressure.
PR The main properties of this profile type are the smooth inside and the profiled outside surface. Significant low weight and the high stiffness.
SPR This profile pipe has a smooth inside and outside surface including internal profile with one layer. This profile has a very high long-term stiffness.
OP This profile has a smooth inside surface and the outside surface is profiled with an Olympic-rings-like pattern. Low weight and high stiffness.
SOP This profile pipe has a smooth inside and outside including internal profiles with two layers. This profile has a very high long-term stiffness.
SQ This profile pipe has a smooth inside and outside including internal profiles with one or more layers. This profile has a high long-term stiffness.
SP To achieve different kinds of loads, the Krah pipe system makes it possible to combine different profiles in order to achieve the required effects

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Haplast PE preassureless water tanks
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A4: Distance for transport from manufacturer to building site is set to 300 km by truck or lorry. This distance is given in new PCRs as default value
for Norway.
A5: Installation is not included due to different installation methods. Specific EPDs including A5 can be provided on request.
C1, C3, C4 and D: Included as zero due to various demolition scenarios, however it is assumed that after 100 years of service life, all end-of-life
product is expected to be collected from demolition site (C1). Most of the product materials is assumed to be recycled (C3) while the rest is
assumed to be incinerated (C3) and/or landfilled (C4).
C2: Transportation distance to nearest waste handling facility is estimated to be 85 km by truck. This distance is given in new PCRs as default
value for Norway.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
