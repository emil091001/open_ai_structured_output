Product
Product description:
ROCKWOOL Betonelementbatts 34 is used as insulation in sandwich elements of concrete and clinker concrete, where optimal insulation
performance is required, or where space is limited. The high insulation performance ensures slimmer constructions.
This EPD documents the potential environmental impacts of 1m² of ROCKWOOL® stone wool insulation with a thermal resistance (R-value) equal
to 1 m²K/W. The intended use of the EPD is to communicate quantified environmental impacts of construction products for application in the
assessment of the environmental performance of buildings.
ROCKWOOL® stone wool thermal insulation is a durable and fire-safe insulation material that can be used to insulate against heat, cold, fire,
vibrations, and noise. ROCKWOOL® stone wool is made primarily from abundantly available volcanic rock, an increasing proportion of recycled
ROCKWOOL® stone wool, and a cured resin binder. ROCKWOOL® offers a take-back system for closed-loop recycling – Rockcycle.
ROCKWOOL® stone wool is a non-combustible material that does not react to fire. Stone wool’s built-in fire protection is natural and not
dependent on flame retardants. Stone wool withstands temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius and retains its fire performance throughout
its lifetime. The insulation properties of stone wool are primarily achieved by the immobile air within the open structure of the product. Therefore,
the declared insulation property will remain constant for the declared lifetime of the product.
This also allows the product to absorb noise and sounds and contribute to a better indoor acoustic climate. ROCKWOOL® stone wool fibers are
proven to be safe to manufacture, install, and live with. Health and safety installation instructions shall always be followed.
Product specification
The average composition used for this EPD is calculated based on average factory consumption figures for raw materials. The raw materials are
mainly non-scarce stones, and resin binder.

Market:
This EPD is intended for the Nordic market. The EPD can be used in other specific Nordics markets by adjusting the A4 module to reflect correct
transportation distance.
Reference service life, product
ROCKWOOL® stone wool thermal insulation products are extremely durable and provide effective performance for the lifetime of a building or
host structure, with no need to be replaced. The thermal, fire-resistance, and acoustic performance of ROCKWOOL® stone wool products, when
correctly installed, remains the same during 60 years reference service life or as long as the insulation is part of the building
Reference service life, building or construction works
In this EPD, the reference service life of a building is set to 60 years.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy are included. All hazardous materials and substances are considered in the inventory. Data sets
within the system boundary are complete and fulfil criteria for the exclusion of inputs and output criteria. All data, materials and energy
consumptions, have been specified according to the production data and have been considered within the inventory analysis.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Production activities, electricity and energy consumption and waste
generation are allocated equally among all products from the production site through mass allocation.
Data quality:
All data represents the applicable geography, time and technology for the specific and generic data, generally assessed as good and very good.
Primary data are collected from the specific production sites, in the reference year 2021 and represent stabilized production. Generic data is from
GaBi database (version 2021) with GaBi Software version 10.0.1.92.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The EPD is based on LCA inventory data from the producing factories. The reference flow is a weighted average based on the distribution of
production capacity
Transport from production place to assembly/user (A4)
The A4 distance is calculated as weighted average distance for the Nordic market
Assembly (A5)
In A5 the default installation is assumed to be manual, therefore no energy consumption or ancillary equipment is needed. The product waste
from installation is assumed to be 2% and according to the modularity principle of EN 15804+A2 its impacts are fully allocated to A5, following
same EoL scenario as in C. The A5 module includes also the corresponding end-of-life considerations for packaging (10 % landfill). The credits from
heat and electricity recovery from incineration or material recycling from module A5 (90% recycling and energy recovery) are attributed to module
D.
Use stage (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7)
There are no consumables and no maintenance (B2), repair (B3), replacements (B4) or refurbishments (B5) required during the use of
ROCKWOOL® thermal insulation products in standard conditions. They do not use energy (B6) or water (B7) during their operational life. No LCA:
Scenarios and additional technical information EPD for the best environmental decision 8 significant emissions to the indoor environment occur in
module (B1). Therefore, modules B1-B7 are not relevant for this EPD and will not be displayed in the tables below.
Benefits and loads beyond the system boundaries (D)
Benefits in module D are created from packaging materials treatment after installation and recycling potential of stone wool in the end of life.
Quantities of packaging materials include both recycled materials and materials sent for energy recovery. Recycling potential of net stone wool
material is considered here.

Remarks to environmental impacts
The main GWP contribution from the product life cycle is linked to the Product stage (A1-A3). This is primarily related to the materials delivered to
the factory gate and consumption of
energy.
The CO2 absorbed by the wood in the wooden pallets is represented by a negative GWPbiogenic.
The GWP-Biogenic, e.g. the carbon stored in the wooden pallets, is released during the construction stage phase (A5) where the wood is
presumed incinerated with energy recovery.
The benefits from energy recovery (a negative GWP) from incineration of packaging materials (wood pallets and plastic foils) is allocated to
Benefits & Loads beyond system (D).
Impacts linked to end of life stages (C1-C4) are primarily linked to transportation of stone wool to recycling or to landfill.
Melting virgin materials or re-melting returned ROCKWOOL stone wool are both similarly energy intensive processes. Increasing the recycling rate
for return wool, will therefore not lead to great variations in the overall GWP profile. However, increased recycling will be linked directly to
reduction of waste sent to landfill.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
