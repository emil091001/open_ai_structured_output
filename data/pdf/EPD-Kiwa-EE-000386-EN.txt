The aroTHERM plus 7 kW is also known as “VWL 75/5 6 A 230V S2”. The product is the outdoor unit of
an air-to-water heat pump with monobloc technology. The heat pump has a closed refrigerant circuit
in which a refrigerant circulates. Through cyclic evaporation, compression, condensation and expan-
sion, heat energy is absorbed from the environment and transferred to the building. In cooling mode,
heat energy is extracted from the building and released to the environment.

3.2 System boundary
This EPD was created in accordance with DIN EN 15804+A2. It monitors the production phase, con-
struction phase, the use phase and the end-of-life phase as well as the benefits and loads beyond the
system boundary. According to DIN EN 15804 this corresponds to the product phases A1-A5, B1-B7,
C1-C4 and D. Therefore, the type of the EPD is “cradle to grave”.
The modules include:
• A1: Extraction of the raw materials
• A2: Transport of the raw material to the production site by the suppliers
• A3: Auxiliary materials and energy for the different processing steps; Production waste; Pack-
aging materials
• A4: Transport from the manufacturing site to the customers
• A5: According to the guide by Vaillant only human labour is needed for the construction/in-
stallation process and thus nothing is considered; Packaging waste
• B1: Emissions due to refrigerant leakage
• B2: Refill of refrigerant
• B3: The module “repair” is not considered during the use phase
• B4: The module “replacement” is not considered during the use phase
• B5: The module “refurbishment” is not considered during the use phase
• B6: Operational energy use is considered
• B7: Operational waster use is not considered during the use phase
• C1: According to the guide by Vaillant only human labour is needed for the de-construc-
tion/demolition process and thus nothing is considered
• C2: Transport for waste treatments based on NMD waste scenarios
• C3: Waste processing based on NMD waste scenarios
Vaillant – aroTHERM plus 7 kW & Hydraulic Station | Page 9
• C4: Disposal based on NMD waste scenarios
• D: Loads due to landfill, incineration and recycling; Benefits due to incineration and recycling
For the declared life phases, all inputs (raw materials, intermediate products, energy and auxiliary ma-
terials) as well as the waste produced were considered.
3.3 Estimates and assumptions
As the products consist of so many different components, Vaillant preferred to use a conservative
approach for the transport of their suppliers (module A2). Therefore, a distance of 3500 km by truck is
considered for all components from Europe and 1000 km by truck as well as 19000 km by transoceanic
freight ship for all components from Asia.
The total operation time per year in heating mode t was assumed to be 1400 hours while the total
heating
operation time per year in cooling mode was assumed to be 350 hours, according to the default active
mode duration listed in PSR-0013.
For the end-of-life, waste scenarios from the Dutch Nationale Milieudatabase (NMD) waste scenarios
were used.
The further assumptions are only included in the background report for data protection reasons.
3.4 Cut-off criteria
For process modules A1 to A3, all process-specific data was collected. All flows could be assigned po-
tential environmental impacts through the Ecoinvent database 3.6. Production, supply, disposal,
maintenance and end-of-life treatment of capital goods are included. In the used Ecoinvent database
3.6 infrastructure and capital goods are included. All flows that contribute more than 1% of the total
mass, energy or environmental impact of the system have been included in the LCA. It can be assumed
that the neglected processes contributed less than 5% to the impact categories considered. It is as-
sumed that the contribution of capital goods to each individual environmental impact category of the
module (A1-A3) is less than 5%.
As this EPD is not a declaration at company level, but a declaration at product level, capital goods for
the production site are not taken into account, nor are packaging materials for the raw and auxiliary
materials.
3.5 Period under review
All process-specific data were collected for the operating year 2021.
3.6 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or assessment of the environmental impact of different products is only
possible if they have been produced in accordance with EN 15804. For the assessment of comparabil-
ity, the following aspects in particular must be taken into account: PCR used, functional or declared
unit, geographical reference, definition of the system boundary, declared modules, data selection (pri-
mary or secondary data, background database, data quality), scenarios used for the use and disposal
phases, and the life cycle inventory (data collection, calculation methods, allocations, validity period).
Vaillant – aroTHERM plus 7 kW & Hydraulic Station | Page 10
3.7 Background data
All the background data is taken from the Ecoinvent database version 3.6 (2019). The life cycle was
modelled with the help of the EPD & LCA tool R<THiNK. Almost all consistent datasets contained in the
Ecoinvent database version 3.6 (2019) are documented and can be viewed in the online documenta-
tion.
3.8 Data quality
Overall, the quality of the data can be considered as good. In the operating data survey, all relevant
process-specific data could be collected. The data were provided by the manufacturer Vaillant.
Secondary data were taken from the Ecoinvent database version 3.6 (2019). The database is regularly
checked and thus complies with the requirements of DIN EN ISO 14044 (background data not older
than 10 years). The background data meets the requirements of EN 15804. The quantities of raw ma-
terials, consumables and supplies used as well as the energy consumption have been recorded and
averaged over the entire year of operation.
The general rule has been complied that specific data from specific production processes or average
data derived from specific processes must be given priority when calculating an EPD or Life Cycle As-
sessment. Data for processes that the manufacturer cannot influence or choose, were backed up with
generic data.
The selection of the best fitting data sets is based on research and the help of experts. The transport
distances for the waste treatments as well as the used environmental profiles for loads and benefits
are based on the data from the NMD.
3.9 Allocation
Specific information about allocations within the background data is included in the documentation of
the Ecoinvent datasets.
3.10 Data collection
The data collection was performed according to ISO 14044:2006, section 4.3.2. According to the target
definition, all significant input and output flows that occur in connection with the products under con-
sideration were identified and quantified. The inputs and outputs were attributed to the process in
which they occur. For the process stages A1, A2 and A3, the input and output streams could be clearly
assigned.
The results of the operational data collection can be seen in the following tables. In addition to the
process-specific data, the tables also provide information on the respective background data used.
3.11 Calculation methods
For the life cycle assessment, the calculation methods described in the ISO 14044:2006, section 4.3.3
have been applied. The evaluation is based on the phases in the system boundaries and the processes
contained therein.
3.12 Electricity mix and CO certificates
2
The electricity mix was chosen according to the geographic reference space and time reference. As
only the conventional electricity mix is used, no further energy sources were considered. The power
Vaillant – aroTHERM plus 7 kW & Hydraulic Station | Page 11
mix composition is based on the Ecoinvent database version 3.6 (2019). No CO certificates were
2
counted.
4. LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following scenarios are used in this EPD.
The EPD should be representative for Europe and thus Vaillant decided to consider their three main
countries of use in Europe. Therefore, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom are considered for the
transport to the customers in module A4. Based on the percentages of the sales figures and the pro-
duction locations, a distance of 921 km was calculated. The details can be found in the background
report of this EPD.

For input flows, there are no significant environment impacts as a result of materials or energy used in
the construction stage (A5).
The following output flows leaving the system at module A5 are assumed.

During the use stage carbon dioxide emissions to the air due to the annual refrigerant leakage of 2%,
which is market compliant, is considered. For this the mass of the refrigerant R290 of 0,9 kg is multi-
plied by the leakage rate of 2% and the Global Warming Potential (GWP) value of 3 kg CO e/kg [Huber,
2
2022].

The total energy consumed by the heat pump to operate is calculated as the combination of energy
absorbed to exchange heat in heating and cooling mode along product RSL according to the PCR B. The
annual operation energy use is 2661,83 kWh and the total operation energy use along RSL is 39927,38
kWh.

Figure 5: Percentage of the product phases in the environmental impact categories of aroTHERM plus 7 kW &
Hydraulic Station
As can be seen in the graph, the operational energy use (module B6) dominates in almost all environ-
mental impact categories, followed by the raw material supply (module A1). Furthermore, for the be-
nefits or loads outside the system boundaries (module D) the benefits (negative values) dominate over
the loads (positive values) in most of the environmental impact categories.
The limitations regarding the interpretation of the results are due to the assumptions made for the
LCA, because it assesses the real world in a simplified model. It can be assumed that the results for the
declared products are representative, because the quality of the data used can be classified as good
overall. All relevant process-specific data could be collected in the operational data collection. Consi-
stent data sets from the Ecoinvent database were available for all inputs and outputs.
As the raw material supply (module A1) has a big impact on the results for all products, the used data-
sets from Ecoinvent 3.6 for the different materials are important. For all materials matching datasets
were found, thus, a high data quality can be assumed.
