Product
Product description:
For various standard applications.
Circular air terminal units for standard applications in supply air or extract air systems with variable volume flow rates.
For more information see: www.trox.de/en/df0fe6200debc478
Product specification
Circular VAV terminal units for variable and constant air volume systems, suitable for supply or extract air, available in 7 nominal sizes. High control
accuracy (even with upstream bend R = 1D). Ready-to-commission unit which consists of the mechanical parts and the electronic control
components. Each unit contains an averaging effective pressure sensor for volume flow rate measurement, and a control damper blade. Factory
mounted control components complete with wiring and tubing. Effective pressure sensor with 3 mm measuring holes, hence resistant to
contamination. Position of the damper blade indicated externally at shaft extension. The damper blade is factory set to open position, which allows
a ventilation airflow even without control; this does not apply to variants with defined safe position NC (normally closed).
Meets the hygiene requirements of EN 16798, Part 3, of VDI 6022, Sheet 1, and of DIN 1946, Part 4.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series TVR-D.
The following represents a representative dataset of the most sold variant in the declared sales year (TVR-D/100/BUDNF).

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
