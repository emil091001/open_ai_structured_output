Product
Product description:
Extruded polystyrene (XPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings and constructions. It's a polymer foam, consisting of
airfilled polystyrene cells. As most of the material is air, XPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics of the
material include low moisture absorption, long service life and high compressive strength. This LCA is based on Jackofoam 300 and can be used
for all Jackofoam products. Please use the conversion table for other sizes than the declared unit.
Product specification
XPS is manufactured through an extruder where polystyrene granulates are mixed with additives and foaming agents to produce the foam mass.
The foam mass is pressed out flat to a board through a nozzle in desire thickness and cut into correct dimensions. Some of the remaining blowing
agents are aired out before the product leaves the factory gate. The number of the product is the pressure class; here 300 which means a short
dermation of 10% when the load of the product is 300 kN/m2.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The allocation is made in accordance
with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all products through
mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling
process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
