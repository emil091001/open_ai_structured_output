Declared unit: Allocation:
1 kg Flowtite Pressure Pipe FP2.1 with coupling DN700-3400, PN16, Allocation was carried out in accordance with EN 15804. There are no-
SN10000 allocations between co-products in the EPD since there are no co-products
created during the manufacturing. Environmental burdens related to A1 and
Cut-off criteria:
A2 stages are allocated to pipes based on the specific pipe composition,
All raw materials which are present in the final product at a transport modes and distances of raw materials to a plant in which the
concentration greater than 0.1 % are included. Some of the raw product has been produced. All manufacturing inputs (energy and auxiliary
materials used at lower content are modeled using datasets materials) are allocated equally to products through mass allocation. Equal
representing the closest match according to the best knowledge of allocation also applies to waste, although for certain waste flows, a specific
Amiblu. The contribution of capital goods is estimated to be lower than allocation was performed based on the production process and product
the general cut-off criteria of 1%. Transport of personnel is outside the formulation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated
scope of the LCA to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling process
and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product compositions are used. In case of some raw materials, data from ecoinvent 3.6 were modified to better reflect the composition of
specific materials used by Amiblu. Transportation modes and distances are collected for all raw materials, specific for each production site. Energy inputs are
also specific for each site. Production site data were collected in the year of study defined on page 2. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented
in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
For A4 stage, a typical transport distance of 500 km from the pipe production plant to the installation site is assumed. A project specific EPD can be provided
on request. For A5 module, a trench geometry is calculated automatically based on the diameter of the pipe. The trench depth is assume to be DN + 1/4DN
+ 1m. The diesel consumption of 0,36 liter per 1 cubic meter of excavated soil is used. In addition, the consumption of 1.6 liter of diesel per 1m of the trench
length is used to account for material compaction and trench filling operations. It is assumed that 50% of excavated soil is replaced with gravel. Transport
distance for disposal site of unused soil and gravel from quarry is assumed to be 20 km on average. Use stage has not been included since glass reinforced
plastic piping, once installed, does not require maintenance. It has been assumed that at the end of the functional life of the piping, the installation is either
left in ground or re-lined. Potential relining is considered to be a second life stage, thus, all environmental burdens associated with re-lining are omitted in this
declaration. LCA study was performed for the 12 m Flowtite Pressure Pipe FP2.1 DN1500 PN16 SN10000 with the corresponding Reka coupling. The
environmental impacts for 1kg of other piping systems covered by this EPD stays within the +/- 10% range compared to values presented on pages 6 and 7.
