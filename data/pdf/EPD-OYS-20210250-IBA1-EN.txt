2. Product
2.1 Product description/Product definition The declared product is a flame retardant polyethylene
terephthalate - polyvinylchloride (PET-PVC) based
technical textile. The base fabric is composed of high
tenacity, low shrinkage, multifilament polyester yarns.
The product is coated symmetrically on both sides by 3
layers of coating, which include a flame retardant
adhesion layer, main coating made out of flame
retardant PVC with several additives and top coat of
acrylic lacquer.
Vinyplan H900 6770 is made with best performance
REACH compliant chemicals. Due to the calendering
processing technique, the declared product is fully
airtight. The declared product weighs 900 g/m2 and it is
part of Vinyplan H900 and Vinyplan 12 flame retardant
product groups. Product documentation is provided on
request.
