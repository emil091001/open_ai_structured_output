Product description
Product description and description of use:
This EPD describes the potential environmental impacts of 1 m² of glass wool insulation, ISOVER G35-U
with a thermal resistance equal to 1 K.m².W-1. The intended use of this EPD is to communicate
scientifically based environmental information for construction products, for the purpose of assessing the
environmental performance of buildings.
ISOVER glass wool products are CE-marked according to the EN 13172 (2011) “Thermal Insulation Products
– Evaluation of Conformity”, EN 13162 (2012) “Thermal insulation Products for Buildings. Factory made
mineral wool (MW) Products. Specification” and EN 14303 “Thermal insulation products for building equipment
and industrial installations. Factory made mineral wool (MW) products. Specification”.
The production site of Saint-Gobain Sweden AB, ISOVER in Billesholm, uses a small amount of natural and
abundant raw materials (sand, soda, limestone, feldspar) and high share of recycled glass cullets (more than
50% post-consumer recycled content of the glass). This material is converted by using fusion and fiberizing
techniques to produce glass wool. The products obtained come in the form of a "mineral wool mat" consisting
of a soft, airy structure.
On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10°C: its thermal conductivity factor,
expressed in λ, is 0.025 W/(m.K) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral wool at
10°C is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0.030 W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.040 W/(m.K). For
technical insulation the thermal conductivity is declared for different temperatures.
With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best
insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs noise in the air and offers
acoustic correction inside premises. Glass wool mainly containing incombustible materials and does not
react to fire.
Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of
comfort, minimizes carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by preventing heat losses through roofs, walls,
2
floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire.
Correctly installed glass wool products and solutions do not require maintenance and last throughout the
lifetime of the building (which is set at 60 years as a default value in the model), or as long as the insulated
building component is a part of the building.

Cut-off criteria
The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details:
- Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the value of all
flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available
- No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows
Data collected at the manufacturing site was used. The inventory process in this LCA includes all data related
to raw material, packaging material and consumable items, and the associated transport to the manufacturing
site. Process energy and water use, direct production waste and emissions to air and water are included.
Scenarios have been developed to account for downstream processes such as demolition and waste treatment
in accordance with the requirements of EN 15804:2012+A1:2013
All inputs and outputs to the manufacturing plants have been included and made transparent. All assumptions
regarding the materials and water balances have also been included.
All hazardous and toxic materials and substances are considered in the inventory even though they are below
the cut off criteria
There are excluded processes in the inventory:
- Flows related to human activities such as employee transport and administration activity.
Allocation
Allocation criteria are based on mass.
The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason we can
use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every product. We only
produce glass mineral wool in the Billesholm site using the same process and therefore all the factors can be
allocated by a mass basis. The amount of binder varies for different products and is accounted for as well as if
different surface layers are used.
A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we have not excluded any materials,
emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the raw materials and
corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.

Product stage, A1-A3
Description of the stage:
The product stage of the mineral wool products is subdivided into 3 modules A1, A2 and A3
respectively “Raw material supply”, “transport” and “manufacturing”.
The aggregation of the modules A1, A2 and A3 is a possibility considered by the EN 15 804 standard.
This rule is applied in this EPD.
A1, Raw material supply
This module takes into account the extraction and processing of all raw materials and energy which
occur upstream to the studied manufacturing process.
Specifically, the raw material supply covers production of binder components and sourcing (quarry) of
raw materials for fiber production, e.g. sand and borax for glass wool. Besides these raw materials,
recycled material/glass cullet is also used as input.
About cullet: The main raw material for the production of glass insulation material is cullets or/and sand.
Only specific cleaning activities and transport is included for the cullets – and thus not the impacts from
the full life cycle of glass. The reason is that cullets are considered a waste product and not initially
produced for the purpose of glass wool insulation production. The only activities included are:
• Magnetic separation of metallic piece
• Separation of other piece-crushing of glass (<20 mm)
• Separation of bottle cap crushing (<2 mm) sieving
• Transport
A2, transport to the manufacturer
The raw materials are transported to the manufacturing site. In our case, the modeling includes: road
and boat transportations (specific values) of each raw material.
A3, manufacturing
This module covers glass wool fabrication, including melting and fiberization (see process flow
diagram). In addition, the production of packaging material is taking into account at this stage.

Manufacturing process flow diagram
Construction process stage, A4-A5
Description of the stage:
The construction process is divided into 2 modules: A4, transport to the building site and A5, installation
in the building.
Description of scenarios and additional technical information:
A4, Transport to the building site:
- This module includes transport from the production gate to the building site. (Representative as
average for the Swedish market). Influence of transportation to others countries (Denmark and
Germany) is shown at page 15.
- Transport is calculated on the basis of a scenario with the parameters described in the following
table.

NEPD-2503-1244-EN ISOVER G35-U
A5, Installation in the building:
This module includes:
- Wastage of products: see following table 5 %. These losses are landfilled (landfill model for glass
see chapter End of life),
- Additional production processes to compensate for the loss
- Processing of packaging wastes: they are 100 % collected and modeled as recovered matter.
This module does not include:
- Energy for installation of the insulation, as the installation is done manually, and do not require
energy
PARAMETER VALUE (per functional unit)
Wastage of materials on the building site before
waste processing, generated by the product’s 5 %
installation (specified by type)
Distance 25 km to landfill by truck
Output materials (specified by type) as results of
Packaging wastes are 100 % collected and modeled
waste processing at the building site e.g. of
as recovered matter
collection for recycling, for energy recovering,
disposal
Glass wool losses are landfilled
(specified by route)
Use stage (excluding potential savings), B1-B7
Description of the stage: The use stage is divided into the following modules:
- B1: Use
- B2: Maintenance
- B3: Repair
- B4: Replacement
- B5: Refurbishment
- B6: Operational energy use
- B7: Operational water use
Description of scenarios and additional technical information:
Once installation is complete, no actions or technical operations are required during the use stages until
the end of life stage. Therefore, glass wool insulation products have no impact (excluding potential
energy savings) on this stage.
End-of-life stage C1-C4
Description of the stage: The stage includes the different modules of end-of-life detailed below.
C1, de-construction, demolition
The de-construction and/or dismantling of insulation products take part of the demolition of the entire
building and is assumed to be made manually. In our case, the environmental impact is assumed to be
very small and can be neglected.
C2, transport to waste processing
Transport is included and calculated on the basis of a scenario with the parameters described in the
End-of-life table.
C3, waste processing for reuse, recovery and/or recycling;
Today the product is considered to be landfilled without reuse, recovery or recycling.
C4, disposal;
The glass wool is assumed to be 100% landfilled.

landfill).
Reuse/recovery/recycling potential, D
Description of the stage: For module D we only take into consideration the materials used within
the product, and not e.g. packaging and that the benefit then will be equal to zero.
LCA results
LCA model, aggregation of data and potential environmental impact are calculated from the GaBi
software 8.7 and CML impact method has been used, together with thinkstep 8.7 (2018) and ecoinvent
V3.1 (2014) databases to obtain the inventory of generic data. Biogenic carbon is not reported in the
context of GWP.
Raw materials and energy consumption, as well as transport distances have been taken directly from
the manufacturing plant of Saint-Gobain Sweden A, ISOVER in Billesholm (Production data according
2018).

[4] This indicator corresponds to the sum of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste disposed.
Global Warming Potential (Climate Change) (GWP)
When analyzing the above figure for GWP, it can clearly be seen that the majority of contribution to this
environmental impact is from the production modules (A1 – A3). This is primarily because the sources of
greenhouse gas emissions are predominant in this part of the life cycle. CO2 is generated upstream from the
production of electricity and is also released on site by the combustion of natural gas. We can see that other
sections of the life cycle also contribute to the GWP; however, the production modules contribute to over 80%
of the contribution. Combustion of fuel in transport vehicles will generate the second highest percentage of
greenhouse gas emissions together the waste during the installation stage.
Global warming potential does not account for emission and uptake of biogenic CO .

Non-renewable resources consumptions
We can see that the consumption of non – renewable resources is once more found to have the highest value
in the production modules. This is because a large quantity of natural gas is consumed within the factory, and
non – renewable fuels such as natural gas and coal are used to generate the large amount of electricity we
use. The contribution to this impact from the other modules is very small and primarily due to the non –
renewable resources consumed during transportation.
Energy Consumptions
As we can see, modules A1 – A3 have the highest contribution to total energy consumption. Energy in the
form of electricity and natural gas is consumed in a vast quantity during the manufacture of glass mineral wool
so we would expect the production modules to contribute the most to this impact category.

Water Consumption
As we don’t use water in any of the other modules (A4 – A5, B1 – B7, C1 – C4), we can see that there is no
contribution to water consumption. For the production phase, water is used within the manufacturing facility
and therefore we see the highest contribution here. However, we recycle a lot of the water on site so the
contribution is still relatively low.
Waste Production
Waste production does not follow the same trend as the above environmental impacts. The largest contributor
is the end of life module. This is because the entire product is sent to landfill once it reaches the end of life
state. However, there is still an impact associated with the production module since we do generate waste on
site. The following small impact associated with installation is due to the loss rate of product during
implementation.
Additional information
Influence of particular thicknesses
All the results in the table of this EPD refer to ISOVER G35-U with a thickness of 33 mm for a functional unit
of 1 m² with a thermal resistance equals to 1.00 m² K/W
This EPD of ISOVER G35-U includes a range of thicknesses between 20 mm and 100 mm. For every
thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of every thickness. In
order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1.00 m² K/W for
33 mm).
The various multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all thicknesses. including
packaging. The GWP value in each thickness is chosen as a reference indicator to obtain the multiplication
factor. Using the thickness factor will for some indicators give higher values than calculated for the specific
thickness in GaBi.
In the table below the multiplication factors are shown for products and specific thickness of the product family.
In order to obtain the environmental performance associated with every specific product and thickness, the
results expressed in this EPD must be multiplied by its corresponding multiplication factor.
