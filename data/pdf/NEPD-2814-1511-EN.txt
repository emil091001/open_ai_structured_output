Declared unit: Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804.
1 kg Lindab Profiled Sheeting - PreCoated
Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
Cut-off criteria: equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary
production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
material is allocated to this analysis.
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
For A1-A4 the data is actual data or suggestions from the c-CPR. For the other modules conservative assumptions have been made. For Assembly(A5) and
Deconstruction (C1) Bucht & Korhonen's report regarding Energy Consumption during Construction phase has been used.

System boundary:
Module A1-A5, C1-C4 and D is included in the analysis. That means everything except the usage stage. That is excluded since the product has very limited
effect on the environment during this phase of its lifetime.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The after life scenario assumes 100% recycling of steel. The same energy consumption has been assumed for assembly and deconstruction. During assembly
no scrap has been assumed since the product is custom made in the right dimensions for each construction.
