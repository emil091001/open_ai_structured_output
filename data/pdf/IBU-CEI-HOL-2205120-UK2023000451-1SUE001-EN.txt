Cement: Includes the impacts for the production of all cements used. Aggregate: Includes the impacts for the production
of sand and gravel. Cementitious: Includes the impacts for the production of all cementitious materials used such as
Legend slag, fly ash or limestone. Fibers: Includes the impacts for the production of fibers. Admixtures: Includes the impacts for
the production of concrete admixtures such as plasticisers or retarders. Other materials and processes: Includes the
impacts of materials or production processes not covered by the above categories.
