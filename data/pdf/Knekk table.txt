markers and other tools are active parts of the task and needs a clean work
surface and engaged creative people. Jon Fauske has designed a table
specifically for innovative design-oriented processes.
Reference service life, building
The Knekk table offers a clean surface without any disruptions and
enables working from all four sides of the table. The slot in the base
enables storage for PC’s and other tools or diversions that are not required
for the specific phase of the process. In addition to the slot the table has
four holes perforated in the steel base to integrate electrical sockets.

The Knekk table also has the option to attach a retractable paper-roll as
an accessory if required by the process.
