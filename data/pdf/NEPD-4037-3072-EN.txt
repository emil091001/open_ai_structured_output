The results in this EPD are provided for a declared unit and shall be recalculated to a functional
unit. The table 2 below provides scaling factors to 1 m2 of all Hunton Vindtett variants. The
environmental impact of the functional unit (1 m2) can be calculated by multiplying results for
the declared unit (given per 1 kg) by appropriate scaling factor.

Market:
Nordic and European market. Boards are being sold in Scandinavia under tradename Hunton
Vindtett, nonetheless on the other markets Hunton Vindtät™, Tuulensuojalevy™, Windproof or
Bitroc is being used. Scenarios assessed in this study were developed for Norway.

LCA: Calculation rules
Functional unit:
1 m2 of installed Hunton Vindtett boards, from cradle to grave, with lifetime of 60 years.
Declared unit:
The declared unit used for the calculations was 1 kg of installed Hunton Vindtett boards.
Data quality:
The Ecoinvent database (version 3.8) was used as the main source of data for modelling the
background system and the whole value chain. All generic data used in the study are not older
than 10 years. Specific system data were collected by the manufacturer and provided to the
developer of the EPD using an appropriate data collection file. Data were discussed between the
two involved parts to ensure representativity of the system and to produce a reliable model.
Results were compared to similar production systems. Employed data were collected for the
year 2021.
Allocation:
Allocation was done based on specifications stated in the newly published standard EN 15804 +
A2:2019. Energy and water use. as well as generated waste were allocated evenly to the product
using mass allocation. Material recycling and transport was also allocated accordingly.
EPD for the best environmental decision 4
System boundary:
Figure 2. System boundaries.
The studied system includes the following modules: A1(raw materials), A2 (transport of raw
materials), A3 (manufacturing), A4 (transport to the construction site), A5 (Assembly), C1
(disassembly), C2 (transport to waste processing), C3 (waste processing), C4 (waste disposal),
and D (benefits beyond the system boundaries). The above phases were conducted in
accordance with specifications in the new EN15804 + A2:2019 and NPCR Part A Construction
products and services version 2. No scenarios were developed for the use phase (modules B1-
B7) as the environmental impacts are negligible. Hunton Vindtett requires no maintenance,
replacement nor additional treatment or energy if properly installed according to the existing
guidelines.
Cut-off criteria:
All the important raw materials and energy use are included in the calculations. For some raw
materials. proxy datasets were used in the model as approximations. This does not include
hazardous materials. The calculations include 100% of materials that make up the product and
the packaging.
LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describes the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.

Additional environmental impact indicators required in NPCR Part A for construction
products
In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon contribution to climate impact. the
indicator for GWP has been sub-divided into the following:
GWP-IOBC Climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation
GWP-BC Climate impacts from the net uptake and emission of biogenic carbon from each
module.
In addition. EP-freshwater shall also be declared as PO4 eq.

Hazardous substances
The declaration is based upon reference to threshold values and/or test results and/or material
safety data sheets provided to EPD verifiers. Documentation available upon request to EPD
owner.
□ The product contains no substances given by the REACH Candidate list or the
Norwegian priority list.
 The product contains substances given by the REACH Candidate list or the Norwegian
priority list that are less than 0.1 % by weight.
□ The product contains dangerous substances more than 0.1% by weight, given by the
REACH Candidate List or the Norwegian Priority list, see table.
□ The product contains no substances given by the REACH Candidate list or the
Norwegian priority list. The product is classified as hazardous waste (Avfallsforskiften.
Annex III). see table.
According to SINTEF Technical Approval nr 2002 Hunton Vindtett does not contain any
substances from the priority list in quantities which might be assessed as hazardous for health
or environment.
Indoor environment
The product meets the M1 requirements specified in the classification of indoor air 2018 as well
as in the general specifications for the classification of building.
Carbon footprint
Calculations related to climate change and global warming potential (GWP) include greenhouse
gas emissions from fossil sources and land use change connected to extraction of raw materials.
Biogenic emissions of CO2 are also calculated and included.
