Product
Product description:
Product variation and calculation of averages:
- The insulation board is provided in several dimensions and thicknesses. Please use the conversion table in this EPD for other sizes and densities
than the declared variant.
Product description:
- Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings, including floors, walls and roofs. It is a polymer foam,
consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells. As 98% of the material is air, EPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics
of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life, high compressive strength and 100% recyclable.
- GreenLine RE80 insulation boards are made from recycled EPS. This recycling process begins with the collection and compacting of used EPS
waste from the fish and packaging industries. The compacted EPS blocks are then transported to a recycling plant, where the blocks are shredded
and extruded. The plastic pellets produced as a result consist of recycled general-purpose polystyrene (rGPPS), which is sent to BEWI Raw in the
Netherlands for further processing. Here, the rGPPS is extruded again to create expandable plastic pellets, to which pentane is added. The result is
a high-quality expandable polystyrene raw material.
- To manufacture insulation boards from recycled materials, BEWI Denmark then expands these pellets using steam. The resulting expanded
polystyrene (EPS) is then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure form large blocks. The amount of EPS fed into the mold
determines the block's density, and pressure class 80 (RE80) creates a compressive strength of 80 kN/m², which corresponds to approximately
15.5 kg/m³. After molding, the remaining pentane outgasses from the blocks, which are then cut to the desired size.
-The EPS boards used for exterior basement wall insulation are delivered with sharp edges, with grooves milled on one side, and covered with a
non-woven fabric geotextile.
- Weight per declared unit is 0,75 kg given a density of 15,5 kg/m³ with a thickness of 38 mm including non-woven fabric geotextile, glue and
packaging material.

Reference service life, product
The reference service life of EPS products varies depending on where in the building the products are used. In Denmark, the service life tables
from BUILD are used to determine the reference service life of EPS in various building contexts (according to BR18 § 297 Stk. 7).

Reference service life, building or construction works
The reference service life of a building varies depending on the building type. In Denmark, the service life tables from BUILD are used to determine
the reference service life of the various building types.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Product & Construction installation stages (A1-A5)
- The product stage includes the acquisition of all raw materials, products and energy, transport to the production site, packaging, and waste
processing up to the ‘‘end-of-waste” state or final disposal.
- No solid waste is generated from the production of EPS products, as the waste is immediately returned to production line (however, some solid
waste is produced from the raw material packaging, e.g., cardboard).
- The pentane content in the EPS products is highest right after production, after which it continues to decrease. After approximately one month
almost all the pentane has been emitted from the products. The release of pentane is reported in module A3 since it relates to the production.
- A2-A4 is based on a weighted average for BEWI Denmark's Danish production sites (BEWI Hedensted and Maribo).
- For A4, a weighted average distance is calculated based on the distance from BEWI Hedensted to three outer areas: Skagen, Padborg and
Nyborg, and from BEWI Maribo to Copenhagen, Kalundborg and Odense. The weighted average distance is 170 km.
End of Life stage (C1-C4) includes:
- The EPS product is dismantled manually, thus, no environmental impacts are associated with module C1. The dismantled EPS product is
transported 20 km to an incineration plant by a EURO 6 diesel truck.
- Incineration of the dismantled EPS is included in module C3. Energy credits related to energy recovery from the incineration is included in
module D.
Re-use, recovery, and recycling potential (D) includes:
- Credits for energy recovery related to the incineration is included in module D.
- The packaging materials, LDPE foil and EPS pallets, reach the end-of-waste stage in module A5, and the benefits from recycling and incineration
of the packaging materials are included in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
