LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg weber WP Waterproofing membrane (weber WP Vedeneristysmassa)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small amounts (less than 1%) are
not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all products
through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling process and
transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were collected for EPD
development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is
presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw material extraction to product transport to the building site, assembly as well as end of life stage and phases beyond the system boundary (A1-A5,
C1-C4, D) are included in the analysis.
The production process comprises of mixing raw materials together. Ready mixed product is then packed into plastic pails with lid for delivery. Stage B is not considered.
At the end-of-life stage the impact of the product in building deconstruction is considered to be minor, therefore no impact is calculated in C1. Default waste scenario
from NPCR Part B Technical - Chemical products for building and construction industry is applied. Thus, at end-of-life, 10% of the product is collected for material
recycling and 90% is disposed into landfill.
Packaging of most representative product is selected for the study.
System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below.
Additional technical information:
The LCA calculation has been made taking into account the fact that during the manufacturing process 100% renewable electricity is used. This 100% renewable
electricity bought is evidenced by Guarantee of Origin certificates (GOs) from LOS, valid for the study year (2021) and after.
Package contains 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, and can be recycled.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The results of stage A4 (transportation of product) in the table of this EPD refer to transportation in Finland (average distance 2021). This product may also be delivered to
the countries in the table "Additional A4 information". In order to adapt the impact of transportation to these countries, A4 figures from this EPD shall be multiplied by the
multiplication factors below.
At installation stage, no additional accessory was taken into account. Material loss is considered to be 0.
Due to minor impact in deconstruction phase, C1 is set 0. Transportation distance to waste disposal is assumed to be 30 km. It is assumed that 90% of the product is
disposed into landfill and 10% is collected and recycled.
