Product
Product description:
Dynamic and practical storage with a focus on flexibility and options to meet the unique needs of each room. All modules can be combined both
horizontally and vertically.
Create your own storage by combining practical wardrobes with shoe racks, benches, and personalized storage. Doors are available in multiple
heights and can be chosen with different types of locks, handles, and knobs. Add open or low storage to create the right ambiance in the room.
The modules are installed on plinths that come in three optional heights.
Shape Storage Low is available with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 or 12 lockers, in a variety of colors and veneers.
Shape Storage Low can also be chosen in depths of 431 or 596 mm. (These depths are with doors. Doors are calculated in options.) (Depths
without doors: 415 and 580 mm).

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
