Within the cradle to grave, the following aspects have importance. The treatment of wastewater from the
been identified as major contributors, mainly in the painting cabin also contributes significantly to potential
categories Global Warming Potential and Abiotic impacts in terms of Eutrophication.
depletion of fossil resources:
The clinker (cement) production is the most critical
 Emissions from the clinker production from process of the Troldtekt product system, but
material inaccuracies around the amount used will not
invalidate the present conclusions.
 Emissions from the clinker production from

Notably, by introducing more up-to-date LCA datasets
 Substituted emissions from end of life for the grey cement applied, or introducing cements
incineration with less carbon footprint into production, as well as
improved paint consumption management, could lead
to significant reductions of especially the Global
