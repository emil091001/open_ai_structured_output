The functional unit has been defined as 1 m2 of installed ComfortWorx®
Carpet Tile.
The EPD was generated with the help of Envision LCA Tool, version 1. The
tool has not been manipulated in calculating impact results. The current
version of the tool is maintained, saved, and stored for 10 years to be used
for revision and re-traceability purposes.
The owner of the declaration shall be liable for the underlying information

Disclaimer 1: For the indicator 'Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235". This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation
from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2: For the indicators 'Abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources', 'Abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources”,
“Water (user) deprivation potential", "Deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”,
“Potential comparative toxic unit for humans -cancerogenic”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for humans -non-carcinogenic”, “Potential
soil quality index”. The results of these environmental impact indicators shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are
high or as there is limited experienced with the indicators. This EPD was created using a software tool.
