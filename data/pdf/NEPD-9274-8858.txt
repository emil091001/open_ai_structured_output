Product
Product description:
GRAFT® Mineral Fibre Bio is made from special alkaline earth silicate (AES) fibres that have been uniquely engineered to offer advantages in high
temperature insulation applications. These wool blanket products are lightweight, have low thermal conductivity, low heat storage and excellent
resistance to thermal shock.
It is also suitable for use in a wide range of high temperature applications such as furnace lining and blast furnace operation. It can also be used in
fire-stopping applications as an easy-to-install, thermal backing material for fire protection sealants. Mineral Fibre Bio is user-friendly and
considered a superior alternative to stonewool (rockwool) as it is easier to shape and fit and its high temperature endurance.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m2 GRAFT Mineral Fibre Bio for Sweden
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-grave study, excluding the use phase (B1-B7). It includes the extraction and production of raw materials and
packaging, transportation to the manufacturing site, the production process itself, transportation to the construction site, waste management
during product installation, demolition, transportation to waste treatment, the waste treatment process, landfill of materials, as well as avoided
emissions and resource use in a new product.
A4: Transportation from the factory in England to Sweden is included. Additionally, 300 km of transportation from our warehouse to the
construction site is added according to the PCR.
A5: Manual installation is assumed, and electricity is not accounted for. No sealants/adhesives are included. Our fire-rated products are system-
approved and have EPDs for the necessary products. We expect the EPDs for the used products to be attached as documentation. 0% material
loss is included during installation. All packaging is sent for average waste treatment.
C1: Average datasets are used for demolition.
C2: 50 km of transportation to the nearest waste treatment facility is assumed.
C3: No part of the product is assumed to be sent for incineration. 98% of the product is assumed to be reused in a new project.
C4: 2% of the product is assumed to be sent to landfill due to contamination of sealant during installation, as well as damage during dismantling.
D: 98% of the product is assumed to be reused since the material does not lose its insulation value. Extraction and processing of new material are
deducted.
Additional technical information:
GRAFT Mineral Fibre Bio can be easily removed and reused if the product is undamaged.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
