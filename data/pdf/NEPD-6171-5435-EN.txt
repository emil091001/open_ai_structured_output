Product
Product description:
This is a specific product EPD for the concrete type:
Aggressive 35 MPa SCC concrete with AALBORG SOLID cement (CEM II/A-V 42,5 N).
This product-EPD covers all variants of this concrete type with and without pozzolans as fly ash and silica fume. This product-EPD also covers all
available consistency and Dmax variants of the concrete type.
This EPD does not cover the additional components as plastic or steel fibers, which can be requested to be added to the concrete by the costumer.
An EPD for these components can be supplied separately upon request.
For more information, see UNICON's publications:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

This EPD is produced in compliance with Dansk Beton's EPD guidelines (Dansk Betons EPD Retningslinjer). These guidelines are made in
collaboration with all members of Dansk Beton, who are using the EPD tool, and ensure a consistent procedure for data collection and calculation
across the Danish concrete industry.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
