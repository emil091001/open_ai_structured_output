Product
Product description:
Protecta FR IPT is a high performance, professional quality, one part ready to use sealant and adhesive. Based on an innovative Inert Polymer
Technology it is suitable for a wide variety of building trade applications including decorating, flooring, joinery, plumbing and tiling and
outperforms conventional silicone, MSP, butyl and acrylic based products as a sealant and adhesive – free from dangerous emissions.
FR IPT is designed for sealing joints, voids/irregular holes in walls, partitions and other structures, resulting in an airtight and watertight seal. IPT is
a non-reactive chemistry that ensures compatibility with most building materials and has the unique property of moving dynamically to
accommodate the natural or unexpected movements of sealed/bonded joints within a building, for long-lasting performance.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Protecta FR IPT (plastic cartridge)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials and packaging, transportation
to the manufacturing site, as well as the manufacturing process itself.
Additional technical information:
Protecta FR IPT can be removed with a knife/scraper and disposed of at an approved waste facility.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.
