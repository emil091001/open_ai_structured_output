LCA: Results
The results are valid for the declared product with a maximum total weight of 3,4 kg/m².
The declared result figures in module B2 have to be multiplied by the assumed service life (in years) of the floor covering in the building
under consideration. Information on un-declared modules: Modules B3 - B7 are not relevant during the service life of the floor covering
and are therefore not declared. Modules C3/1, C4/2 and C4/3 cause no additional impact (see "LCA: Calculation rules") and are
therefore not declared. Module C2 represents the transport for scenarios 1 and 2. Column D represents module D/A5.

PM = Potential incidence of disease due to PM emissions; IR = Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235; ETP-fw = Potential comparative
Toxic Unit for ecosystems; HTP-c = Potential comparative Toxic Unit for humans (cancerogenic); HTP-nc = Potential comparative Toxic Unit for humans
(not cancerogenic); SQP = Potential soil quality index
No substantiated values can be given for the SQP indicator with the existing database.
The result figures given in module B2 refer to a period of 1 year because a reference service life is not declared. They have to be
multiplied by the assumed service life (in years) of the floor covering
in the building under consideration.
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator 'Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235'. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators 'abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources', 'abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources',
'water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption', 'potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems', 'potential
comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic', 'Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic', 'potential soil
quality index'. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
as there is limited experience with the indicator.
The CO uptake during the growth phase of renewable materials in the product is 1,55 kg. This amount is stored in the material as

biogenic carbon. At the end of life the stored carbon is released into the air again as 1,55 kg CO emissions.
