Product
Product description:
Toughened Laminated Glass; 1m² of 88.3 edge-processed, thermally toughened glass laminated with PVB film. Toughened Laminated Glass is
used in applications requiring personal safety, such as exterior and interior glass railings, glass doors, glass panels, and free-standing glass walls.
88.3 refers to two layers of 8mm thermally toughened glass with 1.14mm PVB interlayers, resulting in a total thickness of 17.14mm for the
finished glass.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In section A4, a weighted average of transport distributed across countries is calculated.
The figures in section A5 originate from data that refer to waste management.
In section C2, it is expected that 70% of the glass is sent to landfill and 30% is sent for recycling, while the remaining materials are either sent for
sorting and subsequent recycling, in reference to EN17213:2020.
In section C3, C4 and D-RRR, data from the relevant EPDs pertaining to the materials used is directly referenced.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
