LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A4 - "Transport", from plant to customer is calculated on distance of 100 km with truck EURO class 5 .
A5 - "Assemly", refer to NPCR 019 Part B Piping systems A2.
C1 - C4 "End of life stage", we assume that the fittings will remain within the ground, therefore no data input.
D - "Beyond the system boundaries", we assume that the fittings will remain in the ground, therefore no data input.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
