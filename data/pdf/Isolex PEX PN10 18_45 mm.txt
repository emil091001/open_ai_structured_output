Product
Product description:
Isolex pipes are coiled flexible pipes with integrated frost protection. The applications are cold or hot tap water supply, mostly as distribution pipes
between houses, cottages or other commercial facilities, especially when vulnerable landscapes, difficult terrain and cold climate can be a challenge,
e.g. in periods when there is a risk of frost.
The pipes have a construction consisting of a media pipe in PEX PN10, which is approved for drinking water and a protective corrugated casing
pipe in HDPE, as well as self-limiting heating cable as integrated frost protection.
Isolex pipes are suitable for permanent installations underground.
More information is found on www.pipelife.no

Technical data:
For products covered by this EPD the following applies:
Products used as media pipes fulfill the requirements in accordance with EN ISO 15875-2 and meeting the requirements for diffusion resistance
outlined in DIN 4726. GDV and VA approved.
The products do not emit substances that can impair the quality of the drinking water or cause a health hazard. The product has been tested for
leaching into drinking water according with KTW-BWGL.
For technical information, see our documentation for the specific finished mixed product, where PEX pipes as covered by this EPD as a constituent
component.
Heating cables used as integrated frost protection comply with the requirements of Directive 2014/35/EU (Low Voltage Directive) and are CE-
compliant.
The self-limiting heating cable has a nominal power output of 7 W/m at +5 °C, 230 V.
The circuit lengths range from 1 to 100 meters, based on a 230 VAC supply and C-type characteristic circuit protection devices in accordance with
EN 60898.
The self-limiting heating cable has been tested and approved according to EN 62395.
Market:
Mainly Norway, but also the Nordic countries.
Reference service life, product
The overall service lifetime of the assembled product depends on the individual lifetimes of its components and their combined performance.
These lifetimes may vary depending on environmental and operational conditions, compliance with instructions, maintenance, and usage patterns.
Component PEX pipe: The service lifetime is at least 50 years (ref. NEPD-4933-4283-EN)). Component heating cable: The expected lifetime is
typically 20 to 30 years for self-limiting cables.

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and waste production in-house is allocated equally among
all products manufactured at Ringebu from raw materials, through mass allocation. The Ringebu factory has its own water supply. Water is not
consumed, it is used for cooling and then returned to natural flows. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with option A4 transport to market. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials,
transportation to the production site, the production process itself and transport to the market. A5, installation, is included for the transport of
packaging waste from the construction site and the treatment of this waste - not the installation of the products.
Additional technical information:
Professionally executed design, storage, handling, installation, maintenance and operations are a precondition for a long service life. The installation
instructions must be followed.
Pipelife Norway AS is certified according to EN ISO 14001:2015.
