Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD. The product is produced in A3 and installed in A5, assuming
a 2% material loss. LPG and electricity are used as energy sources during installation in A5. The packaging waste is treated appropriately. Module
C1 is included but assumed to be zero, since the product contributes minimally to the total environmental load of a building demolition. Waste
treatment of bituminous materials from installation (A5) and processing of building waste (C3) follow a 100% scenario, wherein all waste is
assumed to be recycled for use as raw material in road asphalt production. The loads and benefits from substituting bitumen in road asphalt
production are included in module D. Alternative scenarios for waste handling are used in an earlier verson of this EPD. Documentation will be
given on request.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
