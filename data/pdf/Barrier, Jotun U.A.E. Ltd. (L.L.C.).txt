Product description: Technical data:
Barrier is a two component polyamide cured zinc rich epoxy coating. It Product mixing ration (by volume):
is a very high zinc dust containing product and conforms to the Barrier Comp A: 3 parts
compositional requirements of SSPC paint 20, level 2. Barrier Comp B: 1 part
The declared product provides very good corrosion protection as part Density: 2.5 g/cm³
of a complete coating system. It is to be used as primer in atmospheric Solids by volume: 53 ± 2 volume%
environments. Suitable for carbon steel, repair of inorganic zinc silicate
coating and damaged galvanized steel substrates, it complies with Film thickness per coat:
ASTM D520 type II zinc dust. Dry film thickness: 25 - 125 µm
Wet film thickness: 45 - 235 µm
Barrier is suitable for structural steel and piping exposed in corrosivity
categories up to CX (ISO 12944-2). It is recommended for offshore Theoretical spreading rate: 21.2 - 4.2 m²/l
