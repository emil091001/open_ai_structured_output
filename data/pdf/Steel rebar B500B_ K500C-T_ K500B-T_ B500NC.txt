For the impact assessment, the characterization factors of the LCIA method EN 15804 +A2
Method v1.0 are used. Long-term emissions (>100 years) are not considered in the impact
assessment. The results of the impact assessment are only relative statements that do not
make any statements about end-points of the impact categories, exceedance of threshold
values, safety margins or risks. The following tables show the results of the indicators of the
impact assessment, of the use of resources as well as of waste and other output flows.

6 Interpretation of results
For an easier understanding, the results are processed graphically, in order to recognize
relationships and connections between the data more clearly.
The figure shows the percentage of the product phases in the environmental impact
categories.
As can be seen in the graph, the raw material supply (module A1) and manufacturing
(module A3) dominate in almost all environmental impact categories.
