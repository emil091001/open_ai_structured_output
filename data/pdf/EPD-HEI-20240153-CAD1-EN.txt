Remark to Global warming potential: For all GWP indicators in A1 – A3 net values are reported. The waste status of all (waste­­based)
fuels has been proven. Gross emissions (i.e. including CO2 from combustion of proven wastes) are 804.3 kg CO2­Eq. / t (GWP­­total),
804.0 kg CO2­Eq. / t (GWP­­fossil), 0.3278 kg CO2­Eq. / t (GWP­­biogenic).
Remark to Waste categories: The waste indicators account for wastes from clinker and cement manufacturing only.
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator 'Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235'. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low­dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators 'abiotic depletion potential for non­fossil resources', 'abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources',
'water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation­weighted water consumption', 'potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems', 'potential
comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic', 'Potential comparative toxic unit for humans ­ not cancerogenic', 'potential soil
quality index'. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
as there is limited experience with the indicator.
This EPD was created using a software tool.
