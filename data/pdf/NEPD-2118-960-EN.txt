Hea 02: VOC content for Two-pack performance coatings SB (500 g/l) (EU Directive 2004/42/CE).
Additional certificates and approvals may be available on request.
LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
This is a cradle to gate (A1-A3) EPD with no declared modules after the factory gate. Transport from place of production to user (A4) has to be
calculated by the user.
