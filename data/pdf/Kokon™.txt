Product
Product description:
Kokon™ has a modern spirit that is unlike other traditional recliners. It supports your body while incorporating a gentle tilting function in the base.
Thanks to its intuitive design, Kokon™ can be locked into specific desired angles and can be complemented with a footrest for deeper relaxation
and comfort. Kokon™ is available in a range of different upholstery fabrics and an aluminum cross base in either chrome or a matte black finish.
You can choose between five different colors for the trio of stitches that adorn the back of Kokon™.

Reference service life, product
Longevity is incorporated into Varier's core values. Upholstery and cushions can be replaced over time and Varier products can be passed on to
the next generation. Varier offers an extended warranty of 7 years on wooden parts and 5 years on mechanisms. Lifetime is usually longer than 15
years.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Kokon™
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
