Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”.This impact category deals
mainly with the eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does
not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in
underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and some construction materials is
also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential
for fossil resources”, “water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential
comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”, “potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”, “potential soil quality index”. The results of this
environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high as there is
limited experience with the indicator.
