Product
Product description:
Hollow core is a type of slab that is made of concrete and contains prestressed reinforcement. The elements have longitudinal air channels to
optimize material use and load-bearing capacity. The hollow cores are manufactured in different thicknesses depending on the desired function.
This type of slabs allows for large spans, which also provides good conditions for a flexible use of the building over its lifetime. It is also a very
resource-efficient product that utilizes the included material optimally.
The low w/c ratio and the high strength mean that the construction dries out quickly. With hollow core slabs, the building also receives very good
properties in terms of sound insulation and good resistance against fire and moisture. Another of the concrete's important properties is its ability
to store heat, which enables a low energy consumption and a lower power output during the building's entire operating time.
Hollow cores are 100% recyclable and enable fast, cost-effective and rational assembly in the construction project. This type of slab is also well
suited for reuse.

Technical data:
Declared element is HD/F 120/27 in concrete quality C45/55, w/c ratio 0.40 and with 6 tension lines Ø12.9.
However, this EPD is applicable for dimensions HD/F 120/20 - HD/F 120/42 as the environmental impact indicators do not differ by more than
10% from the declared value.
Production weight for HD/F 120/27 is 348kg/m².
Cement is Heidelberg Materials Bascement CEM II 42.5 R. See EPD-HCG-20210157-CAA1-EN

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
