Product
Product description:
Vibe Focus floor screen - VF812-F, 725x1200 mm, upholstered with polypropylene screen fabric.
Vibe Focus is part of the versatile Vibe range that consists of numerous partition, wall, ceiling and desk screens with a great many options. These
screens help to ensure a healthy acoustic environment and privacy in offices, schools and other shared spaces. With a wide choice of sizes, colours
and shapes, this range offers great flexibility.
Vibe Focus offers high sound absorption, and reduces the overall noise level throughout the room, while screening off the desk. Vibe combines
high quality with a design that stands the test of time. This makes it possible to reuse this product in new interior design solutions when
refurnishing or moving. It’s also easy to renew the product, as the upholstery can be replaced

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

The wooden frame is assembled togheter with the sound absorbing material at Kinnarps' production site in Skillingaryd, where the fabric is also
processed and the screen is upholstered. Metal brackets and legs are manufactured at Kinnarps' production site in Jönköping. Wooden legs are
manufactured at Kinnarps' production site in Kinnarp. Final shipping of the product is done from the production site in Kinnarp.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The product is shipped to the consumer in Kinnarps’ trucks. Recyclable plastic film is used as protection for the screens during transport. In
general, Kinnarps use blankets and cardboard sheets as packaging material, instead of single-use boxes, which is returned to the factory after
delivery and reused. This method saves 270 kg of packaging material per container and enables 50% more products to be transported in each
truck. Kinnarps’ trucks have a load efficiency of approximately 87 % and are run on diesel with renewable content.
For more information about sustainability at Kinnarps, visit https://www.kinnarps.com/about-kinnarps/sustainability/.
The maintenance scenario includes vacuum cleaning of textiles once a week for the whole reference service life.
In normal use, no repair or replacement is required during the product's referenced service life.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
