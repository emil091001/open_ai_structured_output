Product
Product description:
The F-C2 fire damper is a fire protection device designed with compartmentalization to effectively prevent the spread of toxic gases, smoke, and
fire. Its versatile design makes it suitable for various applications, including residential buildings, industrial facilities, hospitals, and more.
Product specification
The F-C2 fire dampers are available in various options and sizes.
Specific EPD data is provided as a reference for the F-C2-125-H0 model.
Correction factors for other sizes can be estimated using the table in the Technical Data section below.

Technical data:
Technical details can be found at the following link:
https://design.systemair.com.
To estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWPtot) correction factor for specific product size use the table below. For sizes not listed, calculate the
correction factor using the provided equation.
Each size has a specific correction factor. The correction factor is calculated by multiplying a coefficient by nominal diameter “DN” in millimeters and
adding the constant.
Equation for correction factors of unlisted sizes:
F-C2 factor = 0,00953346 * DN + 0,2076
This equation enables you to estimate GWPtot correction factor for sizes not listed in the table. By using "DN" for your desired product size, you
can calculate the GWPtot correction factor.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
