Type of the EPD: cradle-to-gate Basically, a comparison or an evaluation of EPD data
is only possible if all the data sets to be compared
The system boundaries of this life cycle assessment were created according to /EN 15804/ and the building
study are considered as cradle-to-gate, since all the context, respectively the product-specific
modules except A1-A3 product stage are not declared characteristics of performance, are taken into account.
