Product description: Reference service life, product
Designer Olav Eldøy has been fascinated by the rings that spread when
15 years
throwing stones in the pond. The result is the Pond chair, which will
give a ripple effect on both sitting comfort and the interior. The Chair Reference service life, building
has a Natural grip handle in the design, and that is helped by the
Chairs lightness. The Chair is avaliable in colors that are conneted to
water; blues and greens. The chair series comes with three different
types of bases in different materials, as well as wood.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit: Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects
1 Pcs Pond with laminated wood base
of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
