Product
Product description:
Jotun Super Durable 2900 Smooth is a TGIC-free powder coating specifically formulated to meet the stringent requirements of the construction
industry. This powder coating ensures the longevity of designs and building components by providing excellent gloss retention, colour stability,
corrosion protection, and enhanced aesthetics. The coating allows for efficient application, and provides a uniform flow and an attractive finish
even after reusing the unused or oversprayed coating. It is available in a smooth finish with a unique deep matte appearance.
Jotun Super Durable 2900 Smooth meets AAMA 2604 requirements. It also contributes to Green Building Standard credits. The primary
applications are for architectural aluminium extrusions and claddings, although other substrates may also be used. In addition, all Jotun Powder
Coatings products do not contain intentionally added lead. For more details, please contact your local Jotun Powder sales representative.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
This is a cradle to gate (A1-A3) study with options, modules C1-C4, module D and additional module A4 transport to market have been included,
as described below.​
Modules A1-A3 background information is based on CEPE and EcoInvent databases. Where A1 accounts for each raw material in the formulation
per 1 kg of product including the packaging. A2 accounts for the transport of raw materials, distance and type(s) of transport are based on yearly
averages collected from the manufacturing facility. A3 accounts for production data, the energy consumption and waste management are based
on collection of data from the manufacturing site.​
Module A4 includes the transport of 1 kg of the declared product with packaging from place of production to the market where the product is
sold. The calculation is based on average distances to distribution centers in the local market. The declared product is assumed to be transported
with the common type of truck used locally.​
Module C considers the end-of-life of the construction material. The calculations for module C are based on dried/cured paint. Solvents and water
are subtracted from the total coating mass due to the drying/curing processes occurring in modules A5 and B2. Similarly, packaging waste is
generated in module A5 and B2, thus it is not accounted for in module C.​
Module C1 is modelled with zero impact for the declared product. The coating is not removed from the substrate during decommissioning
process, therefore the impact is allocated to the coated object.​
Module C2 includes the transport of the paint waste to the closest disposal or waste treatment facility. It is assumed that the waste is transported
by truck with characteristics listed in the Table. The transportation distance is set to 50 km.​
Module C3 is modelled with no waste paint processing.​
Module C4, paint waste is gathered as part of the substrate in construction materials. A typical disposal scenario for paint applied on that
substrate is landfill, therefore it is assumed that 100% of the paint waste is sent to landfill facilities.​
Module D. Recycling of applied paint is not a common practice, therefore the reuse, recovery and recycling potential is set to zero.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
