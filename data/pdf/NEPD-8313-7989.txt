Product
Product description:
For various standard applications.
Circular air terminal units for standard applications in supply air or extract air systems with variable volume flow rates.
For more information see: www.trox.de/en/df0fe6200debc478
Product specification
Circular VAV terminal units for variable and constant air volume systems, suitable for supply or extract air, available in 7 nominal sizes. High control
accuracy (even with upstream bend R = 1D). Ready-to-commission unit which consists of the mechanical parts and the electronic control
components. Each unit contains an averaging effective pressure sensor for volume flow rate measurement, and a control damper blade. Factory
mounted control components complete with wiring and tubing. Effective pressure sensor with 3 mm measuring holes, hence resistant to
contamination. Position of the damper blade indicated externally at shaft extension. The damper blade is factory set to open position, which allows
a ventilation airflow even without control; this does not apply to variants with defined safe position NC (normally closed).
Meets the hygiene requirements of EN 16798, Part 3, of VDI 6022, Sheet 1, and of DIN 1946, Part 4.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series TVR-D.
The following represents a representative dataset of the most sold variant in the declared sales year (TVR-D/100/BUDNF).

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs TVR-D
Cut-off criteria:
3 / 12
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

B1 - B5 No emissions are released during use of the product (B1). Maintenance (B2) and repair (B3) or replacement of individual components (B4)
is not relevant during the service life under consideration (maintenance-free). According to the manufacturer, the product does not need to be
replaced during its service life (B5). The modules are therefore labelled with ‘0’.
B6 - B7 During operation of the building, electrical energy is required to supply the electric drive motor and setpoint adjustments of the product.
C1 - C4 includes the use of energy and other auxiliary materials required to demolish the building or construction in which the product is included,
transport from the building site to the waste processing facility, distribution of the product to different waste treatment methods and the disposal.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
