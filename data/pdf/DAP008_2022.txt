1.7. Information concerning the product/product class
Identification of the Mineral wool (MW), coated with aluminium and kraft paper, density 14.5 kg/m3(Volcalis Easy),
product: thickness of 60 mm.
Illustration of the product:
Brief description of the Volcalis MW is a last generation sand and binder insulation product, coated with aluminium and kraft
product: paper, available in rolls and panels. Its good thermal performance contributes to the comfort and
thermal and acoustic efficiency of buildings and reduces energy consumption.
This MW is a natural, ecological, long-lasting, and inert product that does not degrade or rot; and is
lightweight. Its main benefits are:
• Due to its internal structure, it is an excellent acoustic insulation;
• Fire resistant, not combustible or conductive to heat;
• Results from a sustainable process that uses raw materials and advanced technologies of
high efficiency;
• It’s a 100% recyclable product.
For the purpose of this EPD, the results indicated refer to 1 m2 of product from the range with the
lower density, (Volcalis Easy) with 60 mm thickness. Because the production process is the same for
all products, it is possible to have the LCA results (per m2) for the products with distinct thicknesses
using a conversion factor, as indicated in the table below.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT
2.1. Calculation rules of the LCA
Declared unit: One square meter (1 m2) of MW coated with aluminium and kraft paper, with the thickness
60 mm and bulk density of 14.5 kg/m3, packed, at the out gate of the production site
Functional unit: -
System boundaries: EPD from cradle-to-gate
Criteria for the exclusion: The following processes were not considered in this study, since they meet the cut-off
criteria of 1% use of renewable and non-renewable primary energy and 1% of the total
input mass of the unit process where they occur, with a maximum of 5% energy and mass
use in the considered stages (A1-A3):
• Construction of industrial infrastructures, manufacture and exchange of equipment
and machinery;
• Impacts of infrastructure (vehicle manufacturing, road maintenance) associated with
the transport of pre-products and raw materials;
• The consumption of energy, water or waste and effluents produced in
administrative areas and laboratories was also not considered, since they are not
directly associated with the production process;
• Transport of small consumables to the industrial unit;
• Other negligible flows, considering their contribution below the cut-off criteria.
Assumption and limitations: This EPD represents one (1) product that is produced in one (1) manufacturing unit and
may have different thicknesses.
Quality and other characteristics about Production data was collected for the year of 2020, from internal and official records and is
the information used in the LCA: according to with the reality.
Generic data used belongs to Ecoinvent v3.5, ELCD, USLCI and Simapro industrial database
(Industry data 2.0), and meets the quality criteria (age, geographical and technology
coverage, plausibility, etc.) for generic data.
Allocation rules: The manufacturing plant where the mineral wool coated with aluminium and kraft is
produced also produces uncoated mineral wool and mineral wool with three other
alternative coatings. Concerning the allocation between these co-products, for all materials
and energy that are used in all of them, the principle of mass allocation was applied. For
materials that are only used in one of the coating alternatives (or two, in the case of kraft
paper), the material was allocated only to that product.
Comparability of EPD for construction The EPD of construction products and services cannot be comparable in case they are not
products: produced according to EN 15804 and EN 15942 and according to the comparability
conditions determined by ISO 14025.

2.1.1. Flow diagram of input and output of the processes
Figure 1. Life cycle stages of Volcalis’ mineral wool production process
The following paragraphs describe the life cycle stages studied for the development of this EPD.
After raw and ancillary materials arrive at the industrial site, they are stored on site in bulk (sand) and in silos. Raw
o the materials are weighed and mixed in the mixer. This mixture is fed to the melting furnace. The molten glass is
drained and goes through a feeding channel that ensures temperature control before fiberizing. The glass flows
through the exit holes in the feed channel, through heated platinum rings. After leaving the platinum ring, the
glass goes through the fiberizer, which, due to centrifugal force, allows the extraction of the fibres, through its
holes.
The fibres are sprayed with organic additives, which promote their aggregation. Subsequently, they are confined
and sent to perforated drums forming a fibre blanket (forming process). After the blanket is formed, it is sent to
the curing oven. In the curing oven, the polymerization (curing) of organic additives takes place and the thickness
of the product is calibrated.
Leaving the curing oven, the cured glass wool blanket goes to a cooling zone. Following this, the blanket is trimmed
on its sideboards to give it an even width. Downstream, the product is cut by saws and by a guillotine cutter, to the
desired width and length, according to the requests for panels or roll.
The final stage of the MW production corresponds to the packaging stage. The product to be sold in rolls goes to a
winder, is compressed and then wrapped in polyethylene film. The product to be sold in panel is stacked through
the stacker, which after compression is wrapped in polyethylene film.
After this primary packaging, the packages go to a multipack system where sets of roll packages and sets of panel
packages are created. They are compressed by a compactor, palletized and finally plasticized in the encapsulator.
The pallets are stored in the finished product warehouse and are subsequently dispatched.
Transport to the construction site or the distributor is outside of the boundaries of this EPD.
