3.2 System boundary
This Life cycle assessment is made for EPD type "Cradle to gate with modules C1-C4 and module D":
The Environmental Product Declaration analyses the production stage (A1-A3), the End-of-Life stage
(C1-C4) and the Benefits and loads beyond the system boundary (D).
The door manufacturing process, the individual components such as framing materials or profiles,
hardware, glass, seals are delivered to the manufacturing site.
The processes that are performed at the manufacturing site are: Shaping of profiles, e.g. grinding of
wooden profiles, cutting extruded profiles into size (aluminium, etc.), assemble profiles, treatment and
coating of profiles and finally combining the infill and hardware with the profiles into a complete ele-
ment. C1 concerns the removal of the door, whereby no environmental impact is assumed. The result-
ing waste materials and quantities are included in the respective modules.
3.3 Estimates and assumptions
All installed raw materials of the products were analysed and the masses were determined. Produc-
tion-specific energy consumption were measured and provided by Bitus Latvia SIA. Supplier Infor-
mation regarding the transport distances were provided by Bitus Latvia SIA.
The production waste wood, metal and paint and other mixed production waste are collected sepa-
rately. For plastics and steel, 100 per cent recycling is assumed, and for general production waste, 100
per cent landfilling is assumed, as waste incineration is not widespread in Latvia. Wood waste is ther-
mally recovered at the site. For production waste that cannot be clearly allocated (seals, glass), a raw
material-related production reject of 5 percent was calculated. As the product is marketed interna-
tionally, no country-specific waste scenario can be considered. Therefore, the waste scenario of PCR B
(Appendix B.3) was adopted. Removing the door or window does not result in any environmental im-
pacts, so the value for module C1 is assumed to be zero.

3.4 Cut-off criteria
For process modules A1 to A3, all process-specific data was collected. All flows could be assigned po-
tential environmental impacts through the Ecoinvent database. All flows that contribute more than 1%
of the total mass, energy or environmental impact of the system have been included in the LCA. The
sum of neglect-ed processes does not exceed the 5% of total input mass for module A1-A3.
The following in- and outputs were neglected: Infrastructure of the manufacturing, production waste
and municipal waste (except of wood, plastic, glass, waste water), lubricants and other ancillary mate-
rials.
3.5 Period under review
All process-specific data was collected for the operating year 2019.
3.6 Data quality
All process-specific data was collected for the 2019 operating year and is therefore up-to-date. The
data is based on the annual average. In order to ensure comparability of the results, only consistent
background data of the Ecoinvent database V3.5 was used in the LCA (e.g., records on energy, trans-
portation, supplier), which refers to reference year 2018. The database is regularly reviewed and thus
complies with the requirements of EN 15804 (background data not older than 10 years). All consistent
datasets contained in the Ecoinvent database are documented and can be viewed in the online Ecoin-
vent documentation. The primary data were provided by Bitus Latvia SIA. The life cycle was modelled
with the Nibe EPD App. Geographical reference space of the background data is Latvia. The overall
representativeness and the precision for all datasets were determinate with the Data Quality Ranking
(DQR) formula, a ranking method based on the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) approach.
3.7 Allocation
There are no co-products in the raw material supply phase, so no allocation methods were used at this
stage. There are no allocations during the manufacturing phase at the plant.
3.8 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or evaluation of EPD data is only possible if all data sets to be compared
have been created in accordance with EN 15804 and the building context or the product-specific
performance characteristics have been taken into account.

Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IR: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing radi-
ation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.

5. LCA: Interpretation
5.1 Indicators of impact assessment by impact category
The following figure shows the influence of the different life stages. As shown in figure below, the raw
material (A1) and the manufacture (A3) have the greatest influence on the life cycle on the door. In a
further dominance analysis, the following inputs could be identified as drivers of environmental
impacts. Aluminium, glass, hardware. Potential credits come mainly from the material recovery of
aluminium. From the graph shown below it can be deduced that, in principle, the module raw material
supply (A1) has the greatest influence on the life cycle assessment. For GWP biogenic, it is noticeable
that the sum is negative. Theoretically, the value should be close to zero in total, since the biogenic
carbon is released back into the atmosphere during incineration. This discrepancy is due to the fact
that the data sets do not match optimally. While in the wood products a 2.97 CO is stored by biomass
2
build-up, in the combustion process only a CO emission of 1.46 of kg wood is calculated. The packaging
2
material (wooden pallets) also contributes with a negative input, while the CO emission from com-
2
bustion is not included, as this is assigned to the undeclared module A5.

5.2 Information on data quality
The data quality can be classified as good overall. All relevant process-specific data could be collected
in the operational data collection. Consistent data sets from the Ecoinvent database were available for
almost all inputs and outputs. The background data meet the requirements of EN 15804, and the pro-
duction data were recorded for the 2019 operating year. The quantities of raw materials and supplies
used as well as energy consumption were recorded for the entire operating year. The life cycle as-
sessment was carried out for all the product items listed. It can be assumed that the data for the de-
clared average product are well representative.
Data quality was calculated using the Data Quality Rating method according to the PEF approach. The
DQRs range from 1,75 to 2,0 for the most abundant inputs in terms of mass, and from 2,0 to 2,5 for
smaller inputs. As noted in the interpretation (GWP biogenic), partial data sets are not entirely con-
sistent with each other.
