Product
Product description:
Cofraplus® 80:
Cofraplus® 80 is the lightweight and green alternative to concrete precast slabs. It offers economic advantages, optimized logistics and thus
provide a solution in a green and environmentally aware package. Proposed with its accessories to facilitate the installation, compatible with all
structural materials, Cofraplus® 80 meets the requirements of modern construction projects.
Cofraplus® 220:
The additive floor Cofraplus® 220 combines the high strength of the patented deep-rolled steel floor decking with that of the reinforced concrete
slab. An ease & fast installation, lightness & especially large spans are the characteristics of this process providing great characteristics at freedom
for any application.
Product specification
Cofraplus® 80:
The nominal thickness of the profiled sheet varies from 0,88 to 1,25 mm. The height is 80 mm. The pitch covering is 270mm, while the covering
width is 810mm. Cofraplus 80 is colled formed at the production facility and has a ZM175 coating (175 g/m² total for both sides), which allows
the product to be suitable in enviroments with higher levels of corrovisity (C4) due to its 3% magnesium content, it offers self-healing on cut
edges and corrosion resistance in chloride and ammonia atmospheres.
Cofraplus® 220:
The nominal thickness of the profiled sheet varies from 1.13 to 1,25 mm. The height is 220mm. The covering width is 750mm. Cofraplus® 220 is
colled formed at the production facility and has a Magnelis® coating ZM175 coating (175 g/m² total for both sides), which allows the product to
be suitable in enviroments with higher levels of corrovisity (C4) due to its 3% magnesium content, it offers self-healing on cut edges and corrosion
resistance in chloride and ammonia atmospheres.

Technical data:
ArcelorMittal Construction Cofraplus® 80 and Cofraplus® 220 fulfills the requirement of the harmonized standard of EN 1090, EXC1 - EXC3, and
is CE certified
(Certification number: 0679-CPR-1020).
Performance data of the product in accordance with the declaration of performance EN 14782 with respect to its essential characteristics according
to EN 1090.
Market:
The main market areas are the Nordic countries.
Reference service life, product
High profiled sheets made of steel must withstand a term of protection of at least 15 years. The term of protection is the period until first slight
renewals in the surface is requierd, only if there is no need of frequent inspections and service. the term of protection depends on the location,
weather conditions and the quality of the coating. Profiled sheets made of steel exhibit an estimated service life of 40 - 45 years depending on Life
Cycle Assessment.
Reference service life, building or construction works
As a structural part of the building, steel profiles are expected and specified to reach the same service life as that of the building, the lifetime
depends on specific applications as well as environmental conditions.
LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg ArcelorMittal Construction Cofraplus 80 - Cofraplus 220
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The construction installation stages A4-A5 include the following:
• For the transport to the construction site an assumption of an average truck trailer of 16-32 tonnes payload has been taken into consideration.
Transport distance of the finished product to the customer has been estimated with approximate 300km. All values are based on annual average
delivery data
• For the assembly stage average values been taken.
The use stages (B1-B7) and C1 have not been considered in the Life Cycle Assessment.
The end of life stage C2-C4 include the following:
• Stages C2-C4 include average assumptions, provision for all materials and transports, and use of related energy and water
• lt takes into account the sorting and shredding of after-use steel, as well as the non-recovered scrap due to sorting efficiency, which is landfilled
• Packaging waste is recycled by the customers through their waste management system
Module D (Beyond the system boundaries) is included.
