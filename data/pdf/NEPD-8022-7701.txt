Product
Product description:
Mini Pleat filter cells MFC for the separation of fine dust and suspended particles such as aerosols, toxic dusts, viruses and bacteria from the
supply and extract air in ventilation systems.
For large volume flow rates and long filter life.
Product specification
Used as fine dust filters, prefilters or final filters in AHU units; or as particulate filters, main or final filters for highest requirements of air purity and
sterility, in areas such as industry, research, medicine, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear technology. Low installation depth due to compact V-design,
for systems with high volume flow rates and long filter service lives. Filter media made of high-quality, wet-strength glass fibre papers, with
spacers. Optimum pleat position and largest possible filter area allow low initial differential pressures. Mini Pleat filter cells available in usual market
sizes, filter groups ISO ePM10, ISO ePM1 (fine dust filters) and EPA, HEPA (particulate filters). Mini pleat filter cells are equipped with a
circumferential flat profile seal on the upstream side as standard. Optionally available with test groove seal on the upstream side. Mini Pleat filter
cells used as fine dust filters are certified by Eurovent.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
Filter lifetime:
Filters should work optimally and efficiently during their entire life cycle. This duration depends on the specific characteristics of the filter as well as
the individual operating conditions.
A method for determining this service life is described in standard EN 13053. The service life is reached when the pressure difference of the filter
has either increased by 100 Pa to the respective initial pressure drop (initial pressure drop + 100 Pa) or when three times the value of the initial
pressure drop has been reached (initial pressure drop × 3). The rule that occurs first determines the filter change. These values are valid with
ePM10, ePM2.5 and ePM1 filters. In combination with Coarse filters the value of 100 Pa is replaced by 50 Pa.
VDI guideline 6022 recommends changing the filter according to its operating time. The first filter stage should be replaced after one year and
those in further filter stages after two years at the latest. If DIN 1946 Part 4 is applied, the third filter stage (min. H13) can be in use for up to ten
years, depending on the final pressure drop and the manufacturer's specifications.
However, this service life can be shortened, e.g. for hygienic reasons or because of a defect, likewise for energy reasons.
