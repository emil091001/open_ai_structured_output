Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources”,
“water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”,
“potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”,
“potential soil quality index”. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these
results are high as there is limited experience with the indicator.
6. LCA: Interpretation
Figure 1 illustrates the relative contributions of the different
modules along the life cycle of the declared products The LCA is dominated by the manufacture of the product
(contribution of modules A1–C4 = 100 %). (modules A1–A3).
The benefits and burdens outside the product system vary in
significance depending on the indicator and fluctuate between -
20 % and -60 %.
The use of renewable primary energy is mainly caused by the
share of renewable energy in the electricity mix, thus the
production stage is the main driver of this impact category; the
same holds also for the use of non-renewable primary energy.
Material use of primary energy is comparably small and related
to the use of wooden battens used for transport and storage.
The material use of primary energy is transferred to its energy
use when the materials containing primary energy are
incinerated with energy recovery; the material use of primary
energy is subtracted from the material use indicator when the
materials containing primary energy are recycled. Non-
hazardous waste as the quantitatively most relevant waste
flows is mainly caused during mining and processing of metal
ores and related to the disposal of road infrastructure;
Figure 1: Relative contributions of the different life cycle hazardous and radioactive waste are mainly caused by the
stages for taylor-made welded beams (PRS) (modules A1– nuclear power in the electricity mix.
C4 = 100 %)
7. Requisite evidence
7.1 Weathering If required, the surfaces of structural components are usually
The rusting rate of low-alloyed steel depends on the position of protected with anticorrosion material in order to prevent any
the component and the conditions of the surrounding direct contact with the atmosphere. The weathering of this
atmosphere (corrosivity categories according to EN ISO 12944- protection depends on the applied protection system.
