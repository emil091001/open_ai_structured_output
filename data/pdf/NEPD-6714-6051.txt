Product
Product description:
weber EXM 725 Expanding Concrete Coarse is a dry concrete. It should be
mixed only with water to obtain a ready-to-use, lightly flowing, expanding, frost-resistant, underpinning mortar. For use in layer thicknesses 30-
300 mm. weber EXM 725 is intended for use in underpinning, embedding and encasing of bridge bearings, steel and concrete piles, balustrade
standards etc. and is also suitable for horizontal concrete laying and injection work.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg weber EXM 725 expanderbetong grov anl
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw material extraction to product transport to the construction site and assembly are included in the analysis as well as end of
life stage and phases beyond the system boundary (A1 - A5, C1-C4, D). The basic production process comprises of mixing of raw materials
together. Ready mixed product is then packed into small bags for delivery.
weber EXM 725 expanderbetong grov anl doesn't require any maintenance during the use stage, so stage B is not considered. When building is
demolished at the end-of-life, the concrete are crushed. 90 % of the crushed concrete is recycled and used to replace aggregates in concrete,
remaining 10% being disposed into landfill.
System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below
Additional technical information:
The remaining powder is classified as hazardous waste. Cured material is inactive and not classified as hazardous waste and may be disposed as
construction waste to disposal or recycling.
The packaging properly emptied is not classified as hazardous waste.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
