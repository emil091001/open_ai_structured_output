2 Environmental Product Declaration - Kvadrat Acoustics - Soft Cells Tracks 25mm (aluminium frame)
SC Tracks 25 mm is assembled and installed at the building
site (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain). This procedure
includes cutting the frame profiles, absorber, and Trevira CS
textile to the required size and installing the panel. Most of
these activities are done manually without any materials
consumption. An electric sawn and screwdriver are used. After
the building or the product reaches its end-of-life stage, the
system is removed and dismantled. This process requires
mostly manual work.

Disclaimer for the indicator 'potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235': This impact category deals mainly with the eventual
impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents, occupational exposure nor radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil,
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer for the indicators 'abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources', 'abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources', 'water
(user) deprivation potential', 'deprivation-weighted water consumption', 'potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems', 'potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - cancer effects', 'potential comparative toxic unit for humans â€“ non-cancer effects', 'potential soil
quality index': The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
or as there is limited experience with the indicator.
The major contributor across all environmental impact indicators (except GWP-biogenic) is module A1. This is expected since the SC
Tracks 25 mm is a product kit, the entire manufacturing of components takes place in Kvadrat Acoustics A/S upstream supply chain.
Module A1 has the lowest negative impact in the GWP-biogenic indicator due to the production of packaging (pallets, core board). In
addition, the activities taking place in Kvadrat Acoustics sites relate to the storing, moving and preparing of the product kit which does
not require high energy consumption. Therefore, module A3 has a low contribution to the environmental impacts. Finally, the use of
secondary material includes aluminium and steel (Module A1), as well as a core board (Module A3). The use of secondary fuels is
included in secondary datasets yet no secondary fuels are used in Kvadrat Acoustics sites.
