Product description:
Reference service life, product
Kvart - a timeless and effortless table system.
The base design allows the Kvart series to offer many table types, from 15 years
smaller project rooms to large canteens or meeting rooms with wider
Reference service life, building
tables. The column of the table has space for cables to ensure a clean
and tidy look. Kvart has got its name from the column's profile which
indicates four directions. The four lines prolongate into a T and X base
and even a H base for extra width.

of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
We want you to enjoy your furniture for many years to come. If you follow our advice in this Quality and Maintenance Manual you contribute to prolonged

furniture that can last for generations. All furniture made by Fora Form are made of FSC certified wood, manufactured according to ISO 14001, and has an
EPD on all products. This ensures sustainability and a “cradle to cradle” philosophy. We actively work to reduce waste. All packing materials and waste are
being recycled according to Norsk Gjenvinning.
Norwegian and Swedish Møbelfakta are accredited test facilities where furniture quality, strength, durability, flammability, safety, emissions and materials are
tested and documented. A piece of furniture, which lives up to the three areas of requirements of Møbelfakta, has undergone extensive testing, is produced
according to ethical guidelines and has been approved according to environmental requirements. Møbelfakta is a guarantee of high quality products. Almost
all of Fora Forms collection is Møbelfakta approved.
