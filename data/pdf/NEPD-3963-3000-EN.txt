Product
Product description:
Pretecs Sandwich facade connection PDM is used to connect the outer layer to the inner layer of concrete sandwich panel and thereby transferring
loads caused by deadweight, wind and temperature. The product consist of a diagonal stainless steel wire welded onto an outer and inner wire of
reinforcement bar.
Product specification
Pretec sandwich façade connection system PDM are CE-marked according to EN 1090-1.
If nothing else is specified they are supplied in execution class 2 (EXC2). The declaration of performance (DoP) are available on Pretecs web page.
The system are available in several different sizes, see product data sheet for details.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
