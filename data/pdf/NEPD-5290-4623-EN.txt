Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) can be excluded. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = Transportation by truck (40 km) from the production site in Dong Guan, China to the harbor. After this the goods are transported
by ship (19000 km) from Dong Guan, China to Hamburg, Germany. Then with a truck (650 km) from Hamburg, Germany to the warehouse in
Lillesand, Norway or to the warehouse in Mechelen, Belgium + 800 km for Nordic / Northwestern Europe Market.
Module A5 = Installation is performed in the Nordic / Northwestern Europe Market and done by manual labor, with the use of electrical machines,
that fall under the cut-off criteria of 1% and is therefore neglected. Packaging of the final product consist of a corrugated board box.
Module B6 = The operational energy use of the luminaire is calculated based on the methodology provided in IBU PCR Part B for luminaires,
lamps, and components for luminaires. The energy consumption model for luminaire used in the PCR follows the application scenarios developed
in EN 15193:2007. To calculate the electricity use of the luminaire, the following scenario parameters have been applied:
-Scenario: Office
-Active power of the luminaire (Pa) = 13 watt
-Passive power of the luminaire (Pp) = 0 watt
-Daylight time usage (tD) = 2250 hours
-Non-daylight time usage (tN) = 250 hours
-Standard year time (ty) = 8760 hours
-The occupancy depency factor (FO) = 1
-The daylight dependency factor (FD) = 0,9
-The product specific constant illuminance factor (FCP) = 1
-The non-daylight dimming factor (FN) = 1
-The application specific empiric lifetime of the luminaire in years (a) = 15 years (corresponding to the reference service life of the product).
Module C1 = The de-installation of the luminaire is done by manual labor, with the help of electrical machines. The use of portable electrical
devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off-criterion of 1% and is therefore neglected.
Module C2 = Transportation from building site to the waste treatment facility with an average distance of 300km.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
