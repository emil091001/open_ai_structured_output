amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw material extraction to product transport to the construction site and assembly are included in the analysis as well as end of life stage
and phases beyond the system boundary (A1 - A5, C1-C4, D). The basic production process comprises of mixing of raw materials together. Ready mixed
product is then packed into small bags for delivery.
Floor screed doesn't require any maintenance during the use stage, so stage B is not considered. When building is demolished at the end-of-life, floor
structure with floor screed integrated into concrete slab are crushed. 90 % of crushed concrete is recycled and used to replace aggregates in concrete,
remaining 10% being disposed into landfill.
System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below
Additional technical information:
The consumption of the product is 0,45 kg / m² / mm.
The remaining powder and cured material may be disposed as construction waste to disposal or recycling.
