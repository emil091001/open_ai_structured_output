Product
Product description:
Lily ceiling suspended sound absorber got its name from its early prototypes, which resembled water lily leaves. Since then, its shape has been
simplified and made more open to interpretation. Still present, however, is the sense that it is floating in the air, imbuing the room with a splendid
stillness.
Fully 90 or 120 cm in diameter, Lily is intended for large rooms, such as restaurants and open office spaces – environments where both noise and
visual information levels are high. It’s particularly beautiful when you hang a few of them together in a cluster mixed of Lily absorber version and
Lily lighting version.
Visit the product page for more information: https://abstracta.se/product/lily-soundabsorbing-lamp/.
Product specification
The suspended absorbent is available with or without upholstery. Lily is also available as a lamp. Read more in the product brochure

Technical data:
The dimensions of Lily Absorber 191 900 03 are 1200x61, but other sizes are available. The product can also be made as a lamp; however,
electrical devices are not covered by the PCR used for the EPD. Therefore, it is important to note that a Lily Lamp with the same dimensions will
likely have a larger environmental impact than what is shown in this EPD. For more information about the product, see the technical data sheet:
https://lammhults.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/abs-webpage/EUUqA8HAcbxGgsGJWeOCtQ0BXMPNO-7KOIigdZYIzEPdAw?e=kay9A4.
This EPD is made for a Lily Absorber without upholstery, but with upholstery is also available. Note that adding this changes the environmental
impact of the product.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The EPD is a cradle-to-cradle analysis, A1-D, where some B-stages that were assumed to be neglectable are not included. The A1-A4 stages
includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, and an estimated
transport distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after assembly at the customer. The only B
stage that is assumed to be relevant is B2, which includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to Abstracta's
care instructions. The C- and D-stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management, the waste
processes, disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.
Additional technical information:
To preserve the fabric colour and the appearance of the fabric, Lily should be vacuumed regularly with a soft nozzle.
Polyester Stain Removal: Use uncoloured paper towel or cloth to soak up as much as possible of the stain. Dried stains should be vacuumed.
Moisten the stain lightly with a clean white cotton cloth, lukewarm water and possibly a small amount of pH-neutral detergent. Press a dry cloth
or uncoloured paper towel against the fabric so that moisture and dirt are absorbed. Repeat moistening and soaking until the stain is gone. Use
clean water without detergent at the last moistening. Finish with soaking.
Wool Stain Removal: Dab or wipe gently with a moist cloth.
Abstracta offers a reuse service for our clients. This involves us collecting worn-out products to facilitate reuse, renovation, or recycling. In order to
make circularity easier, most of our products feature replaceable parts, simplifying repair. We do this in hope that we can help contribute in the
transition to a more sustainable future. Read more about the service here: https://abstracta.se/story/abstracta-is-introducing-a-new-recycling-
service-for-used-products-abstracta/ or contact our Sales Support for more information. Otherwise, try to ensure that the product can be reused
when possible, or else, dismantle it so that as much of the materials can be recycled as possible.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to a
customer in Scandinavia, the UK, or France (about 85% of sales in 2022). An average distance to the customer has been calculated through this
data. In the construction phase, the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts were added automatically according to
assumptions made in the EPD tool on waste handling by the customer or installer of the product. In the use stage, the assumption is that the
customer takes care of the product by vacuuming it on a yearly basis. For the end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is a
50 km distance from the customer to a waste terminal. The rest of the values for this stage are automatically filled in by the tool, according to
other assumptions of disposal and waste processes. For the D-stage, where negative impacts from recycling and heat generation from waste
incineration are added, automatic values are filled in, according to generic data.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
