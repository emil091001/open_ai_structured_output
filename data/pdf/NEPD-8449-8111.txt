Product
Product description:
Duun is a timeless sofa with good flow and beautiful symmetry in the design, where the shape of the armrests mirrors the shape of the base.
Duun is designed for an ergonomically correct sitting position and has extra support in the lower back. It is very easy to clean, with a crumb gap
between the seat and the back and cushions that can be easily removed. Duun is a great sofa that has stood up for years, in style and quality.

All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

Additional technical information:
The Helland group is Norway's leading supplier of health and care furniture. Our unique combination of design, production and sustainability has
set the quality standard for healthcare furniture for over 50 years. Helland has extensive cooperation with health institutions and furniture
designers in Scandinavia. Since its establishment in 1947, the company has had head office in Stordal in Sunnmøre, and established its own
production in Estonia 2015. Helland products are sold in Norway, Sweden and Germany. The Helland group is organized into two sales companies,
Helland Møbler AS (Sales Norway, Sweden, Denmark) and Helland Möbel GmbH (Euro zone customers). The Helland group has a total of 70
employees.
Helland Møbler AS is certified according to EU regulations. We use the CO2 equivalent for hydropower.
Helland Møbler AS is certified according to the ISO-14001 standard.
Helland has launched several models with the Swan label, and these products are treated with a special water-based varnish. This varnish has a
high durability, but we advise against the use of disinfectants as this can shorten the life of the product. In addition, the Nordic Ecolabel will also
require that furniture textiles are used that either have the EU Ecolabel or the Nordic Ecolabel.
All our products are produced with FSC approved wood. FSC is a global non-profit labeling scheme for wood and paper. In an FSC forest, no more
trees are felled than the forest can reproduce. At the same time, the FSC label is a guarantee that animals and plant life are protected, and that the
people who work in the forest are guaranteed education, safety equipment and regular pay conditions.
Helland Møbler has a modern production facility where a clean working environment is a high priority. Emissions from production that affect the
external and internal environment have been reduced to a minimum. The most commonly used types of wood are birch and oak, laminated and
solid wood. Chipboard, plywood, and solid wood are used for interior woodwork. All sheet material, as well as glue and varnish, satisfy the E-1
norm for formaldehyde release. Foam plastic is produced without the use of CFC gas. Environmentally friendly water-based contact adhesive is
used for gluing foam. All wood cladding is used for heating own premises. The cartons used are produced from recycled raw material. Cardboard,
paper, plastic, steel, electrical waste and special waste are sorted and sent for recycling. Other waste is delivered to municipal landfill.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
