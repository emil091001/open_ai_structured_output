Product
Product description:
PVC-U pipes and fittings made from PVC-U pipes for underground water supply and sewers under pressure and non-pressure drains, sewers and
surface water piping systems.
The colours are according to the product standards and the colour codes for these applications in Norway.
This EPD covers products as material components, intended for use in various finished mixed products as e.g. pre-insulated piping systems, etc..
More information is found on www.pipelife.no
Product specification
The products covered by this EPD have small variations in composition and are manufactured with the same type of equipment. The composition
below represents an average for these products manufactured in 2021.

Technical data:
For products covered by this EPD the following applies:
Products used as media pipes under pressure fullfill the requirements in accordance with EN ISO 1452 (Nordic Poly Mark). Pipes intended for
drinking water are also approved according to the Danish requirements (DK-VAND).
Products used as non-pressure media pipe fullfill the requirements in accordance with EN 1401 (Nordic Poly Mark). For technical information, see
our handbook:

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Component EPD Ringebu: Extruded PVC-U pipe systems from Surnadal - used as material component in various finished mixed products
Cut-off criteria:
All raw materials and all the essential energy are included.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is not allocated
among internally or externally purchased, components which are not further processed, only handled and assembled, before leaving Ringebu.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with option A4 transport to market. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials,
transportation to the production site, the production process itself and transport to the market. A5, installation, is included for the transport of
packaging waste from the construction site and the treatment of this waste - not the installation of the products. The material data set used in A1
is generated from the cradle to gate part (A1-A3) of a published EPD from Pipelife Norway’s production at Surnadal. Transport in A2 is the specific
transport of the material from Surnadal to Ringebu.
Additional technical information:
Professionally executed design, storage, handling, installation and operations are a precondition for a long service life. The installation instructions
must be followed.
Pipelife Norway AS is certified according to EN ISO 14001:2015
See www.pipelife.no for more information on how we are working on environmental issues.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
