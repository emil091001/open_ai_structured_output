Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Remarks to environmental impacts
This air handling unit uses electric energy for fan drive and recovers thermal energy via the counterflow heat exchanger. These factors are highly
project specific and vary depending on:
- Climate / outdoor conditions
- Air volume
- External pressure drop
- Supply temperature
- Extract temperature
- Operating hours
- Electricity origin
- Etc.
Energy use and heat recovery are key factors in determining the environmental impact of this product and must be calculated with project specific
values. This can be done using our Topvex calculation software, Systemair Configurator. Please refer to the Systemair website for more information.

The air handling unit is an essential component for obtaining good thermal and atmospheric conditions. An optimally sized and well-functioning
FCU will have direct positive effects on human health, wellbeing, and productivity and is a crucial prerequisite for achieving an healthy indoor
environment.
Additional Environmental Information
Additional environmental impact indicators required in NPCR Part A for construction products
Indicator Unit A1-A3 A4 C1 C2 C3 C4 D
GWPIOBC kg CO2 -eq 9,21E+02 5,73E+00 2,26E-01 9,54E-01 9,69E+00 5,98E-01 -1,45E+02
GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
