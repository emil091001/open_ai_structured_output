Product
Product description:
Isoterm pipes water and pressure sewer T75-300-600 and T2000 are coiled flexible pipes with integrated frost protection. The applications are
cold water supply and sewers under pressure for main and service pipelines to houses, cottages or other facilities, especially when vulnerable
landscap, difficult terrain and cold climate can be a challenge, e.g. during periods when there is a risk of frost.
The pipes have a construction consisting of a media pipe in PE 100 PN16, which is approved for drinking water and a protective corrugated casing
in HDPE, as well as ohmic respectively self-limiting heating cable as integrated frost protection.
The Isoterm pipes are suitable for permanent installations underground, and in some cases also temporarily for a short period of time above
ground.

Product specification
The products covered by this EPD have small variations in composition and are manufactured with the same type of equipment. The composition
below represents an average for these products with components manufactured in 2022.
This EPD presents an average of different configurations within the same dimension of 40/70 mm Isoterm pipe. Within these configurations, there
is a difference in the amounts of cable by weight per DU 1 kg of product.
Variability study has been performed. GWP results A1-A3 between the different configurations deviate between -3% and +4% compared to the
average values presented in this EPD.

Technical data:
For products covered by this EPD the following applies:
Media pipes for water supply and sewers fulfill the requirements in accordance with EN 12201 (Nordic Poly Mark). Pipes intended for drinking
water are also approved according to the Danish requirements (DK-VAND).
For technical information, see our handbook:
https://www.pipelife.no/content/dam/pipelife/norway/marketing/general/r%C3%B8rh%C3%A5ndboka/r%C3%B8rh%C3%A5ndboka2021/M-
Materialdata.pdf
Heating cables used as integrated frost protection comply with the requirements of Directive 2014/35/EU (Low Voltage Directive) and are CE-
compliant.
Ohmic heating cables have a nominal power output of 8 W/m (operation mode) and 18 W/m (boost mode).
The circuit lengths range from 15 to 75 m (T75), 60 to 300 m (T300), and 300 to 600 m (T600), based on a 230 VAC supply and C-type
characteristic circuit protection devices in accordance with EN 60898.
Ohmic heating cables are tested and approved according to IEC 60800.
The self-limiting heating cable has a nominal power output of 16 W/m at +10 °C, 230 V.
The circuit lengths range from 1 to 110 meters, based on a 230 VAC supply and C-type characteristic circuit protection devices in accordance with
EN 60898.
The self-limiting heating cable has been tested and approved according to EN 60079.
Market:
Mainly Norway, but also the Nordic countries.
Reference service life, product
The overall service lifetime of the assembled product depends on the individual lifetimes of its components and their combined performance.
These lifetimes may vary depending on environmental and operational conditions, compliance with instructions, maintenance, and usage patterns.
Component PE pressure pipe: The service lifetime is at least 100 years. Component heating cable: The expected lifetime is typically 40 to 50 years
for ohmic cables and 20 to 30 years for self-limiting cables.

Cut-off criteria:
All raw materials and all the essential energy are included.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and waste production in-house is allocated equally among
all products manufactured at Ringebu from raw materials, through mass allocation. The Ringebu factory has its own water supply. Water is not
consumed, it is used for cooling and then returned to natural flows. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with option A4 transport to market. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials,
transportation to the production site, the production process itself and transport to the market. A5, installation, is included for the transport of
packaging waste from the construction site and the treatment of this waste - not the installation of the products.
Additional technical information:
Professionally executed design, storage, handling, installation, maintenance and operations are a precondition for a long service life. The installation
instructions must be followed.
Pipelife Norway AS is certified according to EN ISO 14001:2015.
