Product
Product description:
Litex Membrane Boards are waterproof and vapor proof for use in bathroom and wet rooms, they can be tiled over directly, cutting down on
installation time without having to add extra waterproofing. The boards come in a variety of thicknesses and configurations. Litex is also
lightweight and can be cut with a regular utility knife, making it easy to build custom showers, bathtubs, counters, countertops, and vanity units in
a fraction of the time it does using traditional building materials.The Litex Membrane Board is lightweight construction board made of XPS
(extruded polystyrene) coated with a laminate of aluminum/polyester bonded to the core material with melt adhesive. The lamination is coated
with water-based acrylic. The boards are waterproof and vapor-tight. They do not absorb moisture and are resistant to mold and rot. The boards
have an extremely long lifespan and are durable even under extreme water exposure. The board can be installed on all types of solid substrates as
well as on wooden or steel frames.
Product specification

Technical data:
The Litex Membrane Board has a core made of XPS with a compressive strength of 300 Kpa. Both sides of the board are coated with aluminum
polymer and a layer of water-based acrylic. The product is typically available in thicknesses of 13mm, 20mm, 30mm, and 50mm. The Litex Board is
waterproof and has a water vapor transmission rate (SD value) of 7800 M. The Norwegian requirement for wet zones in bathrooms are SD M 10,
and the product's vapor barrier is 780 times higher than the minimum requirement for wet zones in bathrooms in Norway.
Market:
Norway, Europe. The scenario is based on the application in Norway.
Reference service life, product
The product has a lifespan of over 60 years, as stated by the manufacturer. This is a conservative estimate, and no maintenance is required for the
product after installation.
Reference service life, building or construction works

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m2 Litex Membrane board - 20 mm
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
3 / 12
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
