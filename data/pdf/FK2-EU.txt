Product specification
Fire damper that meets the requirements of the European product standard EN 15650, square or rectangular, with two large inspection accesses
that can be opened without tools. Tested for fire resistance properties to EN 1366-2 (negative pressure of 300 Pa and 500 Pa), with CE marking.
The fire damper manufacturer's declaration of performance (DoP) provides proof that a product is suitable for the respective installation
conditions, e. g. in, on the face of and remote from walls or ceilings, with the stated essential characteristics such as size, supporting construction,
construction and installation type, and that it has the corresponding class of performance to EN 13501-3.
The ready-for-operation unit includes a release mechanism and a replaceable, fire-resistant damper blade, which, depending on the application,
can be either horizontal or vertical. Classification (depending on application):
EI 30 (ve, ho i <-> o) S to EI 240 (ve, ho i <-> o) S.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series FK2-EU.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs FK2-EU
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
