Product
Product description:
Firmly focused on room acoustics, Soneo is a series of highly functional free-standing and desk-mounted screens that comes into their own in
challenging acoustic conditions. The screens provide an effective means of creating a pleasant working environment by lowering noise levels and
enhancing privacy. They can also be equipped with inconspicuous storage accessories made of transparent acrylic, making it easier to keep desks
orderly and free of clutter. Find more information at the product page: https://abstracta.se/product/soneo-square-shaped-floor-screen/.
Product specification
Soneo is a functional and clean screen series. With its sound absorbing core, it creates a comfortable soundscape. The screens are made from a
solid wood frame filled with sound absorbing material, covered in fabrics. Choose your fabric from a wide variety of options.
The product is sold without a leg set for standing. See the product sheet https://abstracta.se/app/uploads/2018/01/product-sheet-soneo1.pdf for
more information or contact us for more information.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The LCA is a cradle-to-cradle analysis, A1-D, where some B-stages (use phase) that were assumed to be neglectable are not included. The A1-A4
stages includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself and an
estimated transport distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after assembly at the customer.
The only B stage that is assumed to be relevant is B2, which includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to
Abstracta's care instructions. The C and D stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management,
the waste processes, disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.
Additional technical information:
To preserve the fabric colour and the appearance of the fabric, Soneo should be vacuumed regularly with a soft nozzle.
Polyester Stain Removal: Use uncoloured paper towel or cloth to soak up as much as possible of the stain. Dried stains should be vacuumed.
Moisten the stain lightly with a clean white cotton cloth, lukewarm water and possibly a small amount of pH-neutral detergent. Press a dry cloth
or uncoloured paper towel against the fabric so that moisture and dirt are absorbed. Repeat moistening and soaking until the stain is gone. Use
clean water without detergent at the last moistening. Finish with soaking.
Wool Stain Removal: Dab or wipe gently with a moist cloth.
Abstracta offers a take-back scheme for used products that our customers want to recycle. We can then reuse the components in the best,
possible way. In this way, we can save some of the world’s resources by reusing or refurbishing some products to avoid throwing away fully
functional material or products. In cases where this is not possible, we instead recycle the materials. Read more about this here
https://abstracta.se/story/abstracta-is-introducing-a-new-recycling-service-for-used-products-abstracta/. Otherwise, try to ensure that the
product can be reused when possible, or else, dismantle it so that as much of the materials can be recycled as possible.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to a
customer in Scandinavia, the UK or France (about 85% of sales in 2022). An average distance to the customer has been calculated through this
data. In the construction phase (A5), the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts were added automatically according to
assumptions made in the EPD tool on waste handling by the customer or installer of the product. In the use stage the assumption is that the
customer takes care of the product by vacuuming it on a yearly basis. For the end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is
50 km from the customer to the waste terminal. The rest of the values for this stage are automatically filled in by the tool, according to other
assumptions of disposal and waste processes. For the D-stage, where negative impacts from recycling and heat generation from waste
incineration are added, automatic values are filled in, according to generic data.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
