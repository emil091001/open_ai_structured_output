2.4 Placing on the market/ Application rules
For quality assurance, the geogrids RE500 series are regulated in accordance with European harmo-
nised standards and marked with a CE mark (or UKCA mark for the UK market) by the manufacturer.
In the EU/EFTA (excluding Switzerland) the placing of geogrids on the market is covered by Regulation
(EU) No. 305/2011 of 9 March 2011. For the product use the respective national provisions shall apply.
The product is packed and transported as roll and mainly marketed in Europe.
2.5 Base materials / Ancillary materials
Tensar® RE500 geogrids are manufactured from high-density polyethylene (HDPE). HDPE is a thermo-
plastic polymer known for its high strength-to-density ratio. It belongs to the group of polyolefins and
is partially crystalline and nonpolar. It is produced from the monomer ethylene. HDPE has little branch-
ing, giving it strong intermolecular forces and high tensile strength.
Raw material Unit Value
High-density polyethylene granules/pallets (HDPE) % 100
There is no biogenic carbon in the products.
The product is not included in the “Candidate list of substances of very high concern for authorisation”
(SVHC).

2.6 Manufacturing
The manufacturing is located at Tensar Manufacturing Limited, 2 Sett End Road West, Blackburn, Lan-
cashire, BB1 2PU, United Kingdom. The geogrids are made from HDPE granulate. In the first step gran-
ulate is melted and then extruded. After this, the extruded sheet passes the punching process. De-
pending on the specific product the punches differ in size. The punched sheet is then stretched. The
result is the specific obround (uniaxial) structure of each geogrid. The products are rolled and then
packaged.
The manufacturing process is shown in the following figure:
Figure 1: Process flow chart of the production of Tensar® RE500
2.7 Packaging
Geogrids are rolled and banded twice with PP banding tape.

2.8 Reference Service Life (RSL)
The RSL of the soil reinforcement geogrid depends on the service life of the reinforced retaining wall,
slope or bridge abutment structure. The RE580 soil reinforcement geogrid is manufactured in accord-
ance with a Quality Management System compliant with BS EN ISO 9001:2008. The reference service
life of the product is up to 120 years. Further specification on the RSL of the product can be found in
the table below.

3.2 System boundary
The Environmental Product Declaration is a complete life cycle with a functional unit. It considers all
potential environmental impacts of the product from the cradle to the end of life.
The manufacturing phase includes the production or extraction of the source materials, the transport
to the respective production plant and the production of the geotextiles. All inputs (raw materials,
precursors, energy and auxiliary materials) as well as the by-products and waste are considered for all
life cycle phases. Finally, only production-related energy consumption (excluding administration and
social rooms) is considered.
It is assumed that no activities for maintenance, repair, transport and replacement, refurbishment or
other material and energy flows take place during the RSL. Modules B1 to B3 are therefore assumed
to be zero. Product replacement (B4) and renovation (B5) only apply when the product is considered
in a lifespan (of a building, work, etc.). Operational water and energy use are not considered.
The year 2020 represents the time reference for raw materials and electricity consumption. Due to the
production location United Kingdom is considered as the geographical reference area. However, envi-
ronmental effects such as the greenhouse effect can occur with a strong spatial and temporal offset.
The following production steps are considered during the manufacturing phase:
• Extraction and processing of the raw materials (HDPE pre-compounded with UV and anti-
oxidant stabiliser packages)
• Transport to the production site
• Processing of the geogrids (extrusion, punching, stretching)
• Packaging (including packaging material)
• End-of-life (including transport)
Secondary fuels are not included in the production process and are therefore not considered. The
waste materials and quantities produced are included in the respective modules.
3.3 Estimates and assumptions
Almost all datasets chosen for the LCA refer to the EU as the geographic reference. Transport dis-
tances for all raw materials used (raw materials, operating materials, packaging) could be recorded. A
payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal
transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific
truck was used.
Page | 6 Tensar International Limited – Tensar® RE580
The distance to the construction site (A4) was calculated according to the NMD (Nationale Milieu Da-
tabase (Dutch National Environmental Database)) method. Accordingly, the distance between the pro-
duction site in Blackburn and Utrecht was considered (900 km). As the mean of transportation truck
(unspecified) was chosen.
Tensar International Limited switched in 2020 to a 100% renewable wind energy. According to a wind
electricity portal, windbranche.de, 50% of wind power in UK is generated from onshore and 50% from
offshore wind parks. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calcu-
lation. No CO certificates were considered.

3.4 Cut-off criteria
All flows which influence is higher than 1% on the total mass, energy or environmental impact are in-
cluded in the LCA. It can be assumed that the neglected processes would have contributed less than
5% to the impact categories considered.
All process specific data could be determined and modelled by the use of generic data (EcoInvent 3.6)
The HDPE is bulk delivered in 24 tons batches – the pellets are blown into the silo. Therefore, there is
no packaging waste for the HDPE.
3.5 Period under review
The production data have been collected for the operating year 2020.
3.6 Data quality
For all processes primary data was collected and provided by Tensar International Limited. The primary
data refers to year 2020. For the data, which is not influenced by the manufacturer, generic data was
used. The secondary data was taken from the database EcoInvent (version 3.6). The database is main-
tained on a regular basis and thus meets the requirements of EN 15804 (background data not older
than 10 years). The power sources were chosen from data for the UK in 2020, in accordance with the
geographical and time representativeness. The data quality is very good, because all process specific
data could be documented and modelled by using the generic data.
RETHiNK EPD web application from the company NIBE was used to model the life cycle for the pro-
duction and disposal of the declared product systems. To ensure that the results are comparable, con-
sistent background data from the international database EcoInvent was used in the LCA (e.g. data rec-
ords on energy, transport, auxiliary materials, and supplies). Almost all consistent data sets contained
in the EcoInvent database are documented and can be viewed online.
3.7 Allocation
Allocations were avoided as far as possible. Tensar uses HDPE for several products as a raw material
and all PP residues, which occur during the manufacturing, are recycled. The residues are not
mandatorily used again for the product from which they originate. The recycled residues might be used
for products from another series.
For example: 5% residues of HDPE occur during the manufacturing of geogrid A. These 5% are recycled,
but due to operating conditions, it is possible that 4% is reused for geogrid A and 1% for geogrid B.
For this calculation it was assumed, that the generated punchout and the regrind material of a specific
geogrid is reused in a closed loop recycling for the analysed geogrid. This was done to avoid product
Page | 7 Tensar International Limited – Tensar® RE580
specific shifts of potential environmental impacts. It was also assumed that the recycled HDPE
substitutes virgin HDPE after a regranulation and that this does not imply any quality losses.
3.8 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or assessment of the environmental impacts of different products is only
possible if they have been prepared in accordance with EN 15804. For the evaluation of the
comparability, the following aspects have to be considered in particular: PCR used, functional or
declared unit, geographical reference, definition of the system boundary, declared modules, data
selection (primary or secondary data, background database, data quality), scenarios used for use and
disposal phases, and the life cycle inventory (data collection, calculation methods, allocations, validity
period). For further guidance see EN 15804+A2 (5.3 Comparability of EPD for construction products).

4. LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
When installing the soil reinforcement geogrid, it is simply unrolled by hand on prepared layer of rein-
forced fill (granular/cohesive material) to the required reinforcement length, and then cut, often by
use of hand tools. Apart from rolling out, no further installation measures are necessary, which would
otherwise be required. RE layers are also installed manually vertically in Tensar Stratum (reinforcement
layers) applications. A reject or unused portion of 2-3% of the soil reinforcement geogrid is assumed
during the installation process (Module A5).
For C1 the process and amount of the generic dataset ‘Polyester weefsel’ (EN: polyester fabric) out of
chapter 22.46 Grondwapening en grondscheiding (EN: 22.46 Soil reinforcement and soil separation) of
the program DuboCalc with database version NMD version 1.8 - 5.01.14052018. In this generic dataset
0.0013 hrs of the process Gr.mach.hydr. (gemiddeld) (EN: Hydraulic excavator (average)) are stated for
module C1 (demolition).
For the end-of-life the NMD scenario PE/PP soil reinforcement (geotextile and geogrid) was chosen.
This scenario assumes that 25% of the geogrid remains in the subground, 70% are incinerated and 5%
are recycled.
Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD
Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km; vehicle:
truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, it is assumed that only fossil raw materials are substituted, con-
sidering the calorific values of the raw materials of the declared product and energy and thermal effi-
ciencies of 18% and 32%. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits
are credited in module D.
For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative
assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different
lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is
calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6).
5. LCA: Results
The following tables show the results of the impact assessment indicators, resource use, waste and
other output streams. The results presented here refer to the declared specific product.
Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IR: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing radi-
ation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.

6. LCA: Interpretation
As shown in the figure below, raw material supply (A1) dominates in most environmental core
indicators, often followed by the production process (A3). In some environmental core indicators
demolition phase (C1) has a great impact. However, C1 is strongly dependent on the assumption (here
diesel consumption of a construction site vehicle). The highest influence on the Global Warming
Potential have row material supply (A1), waste processing (C3), and production process (A3).
Transports (A2, A4, C2) have rather a minor impact within all core indicators.

Figure 2: Tensar® RE580 - Impact of the individual modules on the environmental core indicators
The MKI (Dutch: Milieukostenindicator) value calculated based on set 1 of the NMD determination
method amounts to 0.301.
The data quality can be classified as good overall. All relevant process-specific data could be collected
in the operational data collection. Consistent data sets from the EcoInvent database were available for
almost all inputs and outputs. The background data meet the requirements of EN 15804, and the pro-
duction data were recorded for the 2020 operating year. The quantities of raw materials and supplies
used as well as energy consumption were recorded for the entire operating year.

7. Reuisite evidence
In 2020, RE580 was tested concerning its leaching behavior using the trough method. Due to this
method the institute “Prüftechnik Z+L” could determine the direct environmental impacts to the local
environment (soil and groundwater). In accordance with the criteria of the German Federal Soil Pro-
tection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (Bundesbodenschutz- und Altlastenverordnung) the envi-
ronmental soundness of the geogrid could be confirmed. This result can be transferred to all the other
types of geogrids referring to the product series RE500, and therefore to the RE580.
