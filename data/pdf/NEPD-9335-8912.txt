LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Lyssand 120 Top-swing, wood/aluminium, 1230x1480
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The PCR specific
background data follow the allocation rules in the Ecoinvent v3.7.1 Cut-off database version. The allocation of water, energy and waste flows
within the production facilities for windows and doors follows unit-based allocation adjusted with a point system to different product groups or
products. This score system is regulated by a factor which increases with the resource intensity of each product. The unit-based allocation is
adjusted by the weight of the product, excluding the weight of glass.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Conditions and scenarios for user data in EPD phases
A4
Transportation is assumed at 300km from factory site in Frekhaug Norway. Transported using a large EURO 6 truck with delivery directly to
construction site.
A5
As the product installation can vary from different construction sites, height of the building and other unknown factors, the installation is assumed
to be done manually and no other parameters are considered for this calculation. Waste treatment of packaging is included in the EPD
calculations.
B2/B3
Maintenance is included as cleaning 3 times pr year and lubricating metal parts. The insulating glazing unit (IGU) is assumed to be replaced once
during the 60 year RSL and no repairs are assumed during RSL.
B4/B5
The windows reference service life (RSL) is estimatet at 60 years, there is assumed no refurbishment needed during RSL, apart from what is
included in B2/B3.
B6
The product has no operational energy use.
C1
It is assumed that the window will be manually deconstructed for recycling and waste, hence no energy usage is assumed for this. The window is
assumed to be treated as mixed waste and sent to incineration. Glass is assumed to go to landfill and metals are sorted from the ash and recycled.
C2
It is assumed a transport from deconstruction to waste/incineration of 50km.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
