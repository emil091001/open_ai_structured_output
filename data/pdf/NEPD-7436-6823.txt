Product
Product description:
Splitter sound attenuator with high insertion loss, even in the low-frequency range.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/splitter-sound-attenuators/ms-7db0ac71f60e1f06.
Product specification
Splitter sound attenuators used for the reduction of fan noise and air-regenerated noise in ventilation and air conditioning systems. Attenuation
effect due to absorption and resonance. Energy-saving as well as hygiene tested and certified. Splitter sound attenuator that consist of a duct with
connections and integral type MK splitters or a splitter set. Splitters consist of an aerodynamically formed frame (bullnose radius 20 mm), sound
absorbing material, and resonating panels. The splitter frame reduces pressure losses and air-regenerated noise. The profiled frame with bullnose
edges increase the stiffness of the splitter. Insertion loss and sound power level of air-regenerated noise measured according to EN ISO 7235. For
requirements in areas with potentially explosive atmospheres (ATEX), zones 1, 2, 21 and 22 (outside) according to Directive 1999/92/EC. The duct
meets leakage class C and pressure class 2 according to EN 15727.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series MS-100.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
