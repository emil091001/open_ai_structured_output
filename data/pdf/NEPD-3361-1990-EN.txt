Functional unit: Development and verification of EPD:
The declaration has been developed and verified using EPD tool lca.tools
ver EPD2020.11, developed by LCA.no AS. The EPD tool is integrated into
the company's environmental management system, and has been
approved by EPD-Norway
General information on verification of EPD from EPD tools:
Independent verification of data, other environmental information and Developer of EPD:
the declaration according to ISO 14025:2010, § 8.1.3 and § 8.1.4. Individual
third party verification of each EPD is not required when the EPD tool is i) Christofer Myhrberg
integrated into the company's environmental management system, ii) the
procedures for use of the EPD tool are approved by EPDNorway, and iii) Reviewer of company-specific input data and EPD:
the proccess is reviewed annualy. See Appendix G of EPD-Norway's
General Programme Instructions for further information on EPD tools. Fredrik Warme

apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In A4, a transport distance of 540 km from the Amokabel production site in Sweden to Elektroskandia’s warehouse in Langhus was included. A distance of 300
km was also added as additional transport to market. Installation on poles (A5) and removal (C1) is assumed to be done with other products and should be
assessed at a contruction works level. For B1-B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are assumed to be zero. Some other
potential environmental impacts from the use phase might not be covered by the scope of an EPD. In C3 metals such as copper and aluminium are sent to
recycling and other materials such as plastic insulation is sent to municipal incineration. Net benefit of material recycling and energy recovery is given in
module D. Both aluminium and copper will replace a market average process for the metals in Europe.

LCA: Results
LCA results according to the indicators of EN 15804:2013+A1:2013 are presented in the following tables, for the declared unit defined on page 2 of the EPD
document. All potential environmental impacts might not be covered by the EN 15804 indicators. This concerns indicators such as noise, electromagnetic
radiation, electromagnetic fields and treatment brominated flame retardants.
