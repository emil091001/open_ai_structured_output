End of Life (C1-C4)
Three different end-of-life scenarios are declared and
the results are indicated separately in module C.
Each scenario is calculated as a 100 % scenario.
Scenario 1: 100 % landfill disposal
Scenario 2: 100 % municipal waste incineration (MWI)
with R1>0.6
Scenario 3: 100 % recovery in the cement industry
If combinations of these scenarios have to be
calculated this should be done according to the
following scheme:
EOL-impact = x % impact (Scenario 1)
+ y % impact (Scenario 2)
+ z % impact (Scenario 3)
with x % + y % + z % = 100 %

comparative Toxic Unit for humans (not cancerogenic); SQP = Potential soil quality index
No substantiated values can be given for the SQP indicator with the existing database.
The result figures given in module B2 refer to a period of 1 year because a reference service life is not declared.
They have to be multiplied by the assumed service life (in years) of the floor covering in the building under
consideration.
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”.
This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizingradiation on human health of the
nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due
to radioactive waste disposal in undergroundfacilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and
from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential
for fossil resources”, “water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential
comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”, “potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”, “potential soil quality index”.
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are
high or as there is limited experience with the indicator.
