Heradesign acoustic panels are supplied in protective
cardboard packaging with polypropylene (PP) straps on
untreated wooden pallets. It must be ensured that the
packaging materials are separated and disposed of where such
waste incurs.

Edge processing: 18 standard edges are possible. Cleaning is done by sweeping off occasionally. No effects are
assumed in Module B3 (Repair) because the repair of
Heradesign acoustic panels is rarely necessary. In the case of a
repair, the entire board is replaced, which would correspond to
the environmental impact declared in modules A1–A3.
No effects are assumed for modules B4 and B5 either, because
with Heradesign acoustic panels, when used as intended, no
replacement or renewal is required during the service life of 50
years. Modules B6 (energy use for operating the building) and
B7 (water use for operating the building) are not relevant for
Heradesign acoustic panels.
