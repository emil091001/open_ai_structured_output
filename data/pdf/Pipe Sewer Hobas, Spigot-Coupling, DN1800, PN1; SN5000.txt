Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
For A4 stage, a specific transport distance of 500 km from the pipe production plant to the installation site is assumed.
For A5 module, a trench geometry is calculated automatically based on the diameter of the pipe. The trench depth is assumed to be 2.8 meter.
The diesel consumption of 0,36 liter per 1 cubic meter of excavated soil is used. In addition, the consumption of 1.6 liter of diesel per 1m of the
trench length is used to account for material compaction and trench filling operations. It is assumed that 50% of excavated soil is replaced with
gravel. Transport distance for disposal site of unused soil and gravel from quarry is assumed to be 100 km on average.
Use stage has not been included since glass reinforced plastic piping, once installed, does not require maintenance.
It has been assumed that at the end of the functional life of the piping, the installation is either left in ground or re-lined. Potential relining is
considered to be a second life stage, thus, all environmental burdens associated with re-lining are omitted in this declaration.
LCA study was performed for the 3 m Hobas Pipe DN1600 PN1 SN5000 with the corresponding FWC coupling, produced in Germany.

to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
