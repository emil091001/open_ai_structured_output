Product
Product description:
Ventilating Eaves Vent with rated fire resistance of EI 30, tested to EN 1364-5:2017.
For more info, see our website: https://securonorway.com/products/eaves-vent/
Product specification
Venting through the eave ensures adequate venting of the roof structure and of the attic. It also prevents fungal growth and other moisture
damage. However, this principle has always been problematic
because of the risk of fire spreading to the ceiling and the roof, and by flames breaking out through the windows and up through the ventilation
openings in the eaves.
This kind of fire spread often lead to rapid and extensive fire, leading to major material damage. Previous surveys have shown that up to 80% of
fires in row house buildings were spread through the eave and into the attic and roof construction.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Firebreather Eaves Vent
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
