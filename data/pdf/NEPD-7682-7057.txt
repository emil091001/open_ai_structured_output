Product
Product description:
GRAFT FR Collars are designed to maintain the fire resistance of fire-rated walls and floors where these are breached by service penetrations and
may be used in drywalls, timber, masonry or concrete walls and floors.
Each collar consists of a white-coated circular steel shell that splits in two to fit around the service penetrations by means of a simple ’slide-lock’
system. The steel shell contains a graphite-based reactive material which reacts when exposed to heat from fire closing the openings left by the
softening combustible material.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg GRAFT FR Collar for Sweden
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with options A4 and A5 for transport to the market and installation, respectively. It
includes the extraction and production of raw materials and packaging, transportation to the manufacturing site, the production process itself,
transport to the construction site, and waste management during product installation.
A1: Wooden pallets and pallet wrapping are excluded on the basis that the product is shipped in boxes.
A4: Transport from the factory in England to Sweden is included. Additionally, 300 km of transport from our warehouse to the construction site is
accounted for, in accordance with the PCR.
A5: Manual installation is considered, without the use of electricity. 0% material waste during installation is included. All packaging is sent to
average waste management.
Additional technical information:
GRAFT FR Collar can be easily removed by unscrewing the attached screws. It can be reused if the product is undamaged.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
