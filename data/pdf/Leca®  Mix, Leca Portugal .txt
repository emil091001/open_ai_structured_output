Product
Product description:
Lightweight, insulating premix of lightweight expanded clay aggregate with a particle size between 4 mm and 10 mm, with hydraulic binder and
additives. It could be used for filling of ground floors, raised floors, technical floors and roofs, indoor or outdoor. It can be applied by pumping,
using Putzmeister type machines. The product can also be applied manually, in a bucket, with a mixer / concrete mixer. The product is sold in 25 L
bags , with the approximately weight of 12 Kg. In total, each pallet has 40 bags.
Product specification
Lightweight concrete resulting from the mixing of expanded clay aggregates Leca® in a factory with CE marking in accordance with the standard
EN 13055-1:2002 with a hydraulic binder. The lifetime of the product after application is equivalent to that of conventional concrete. All applied
material can be 100% recycled.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
