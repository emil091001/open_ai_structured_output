Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
Cut-off criteria: equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary
production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The

production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
material is allocated to this analysis.
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
