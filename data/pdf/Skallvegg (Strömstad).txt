apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
Final casting of concrete between the layers is not included in the declaration as the volume of this depends on several project-specific conditions. Modules
A1-A4 are included in the analysis. It includes all processes from extraction and production of raw materials, transport to the factory, the production process
itself. In addition, transport to the construction site (150 km) has been included in accordance with guidelines from EPD-Norway
Additional technical information:
Con-Form has established and follows its own Quality System / Production Description as a basis for the certification by Nordcerts and an Environmental
Management System based on NS-EN 14001
