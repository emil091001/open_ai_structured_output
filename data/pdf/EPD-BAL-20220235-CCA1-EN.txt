End of Life (C1-C4)
Three different end of life scenarios are declared and
the results are indicated separately in module C.
Each scenario is calculated as a 100% scenario.
Scenario 1: 100 % landfill disposal
Scenario 2: 100 % municipal waste incineration (MWI)
with R1 > 0.6
Scenario 3: 100 % recovery in the cement industry
If combinations of these scenarios have to be
calculated this should be done according to the
following scheme:
EOL-impact = x % impact (Scenario 1)
+ y % impact (Scenario 2)
+ z % impact (Scenario 3)
with x % + y % + z % = 100 %

relevant scenario information
Recovery or recycling potentials due to the three end
of life scenarios (module C) are indicated separately.
Recycling in the cement industry (scenario 3)
The organic material of the carpet is used as an
alternative fuel in a cement kiln. It mainly substitutes
for lignite (68.8 %), hard coal (23.6 %) and petrol coke
(7.6 %). The inorganic material is substantially
integrated into the cement clinker and substitutes for
original material input VDZ e.V.

The SQP indicator is not given due to considerable uncertainties in the calculation.
The result figures given in module B2 refer to a period of 1 year because a reference service life is not declared.
They have to be multiplied by the assumed service life (in years) of the floor covering in the building under
consideration.
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”.
This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizingradiation on human health of the
nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due
to radioactive waste disposal in undergroundfacilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and
from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential
for fossil resources”, “water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential
comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”, “potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”, “potential soil quality index”.
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are
high or as there is limited experience with the indicator.
