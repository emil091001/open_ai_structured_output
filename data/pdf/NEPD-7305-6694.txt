Product
Product description:
Round aluminium air diffusers for installation in floors.
The different attachments allow a wide range of applications with different air flows, installation conditions and several options for volume flow
balancing.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/floor-diffuser/fba%C2%A0-eeda3cc7f48864ff
Product specification
Floor diffusers as supply air diffusers for installation in raised floors of all types. Supply air supply either directly via the raised floor if it is
construceted as a pressurised floor, or via a plenum box connected to the on-site air duct system.
Diffuser core with curved mullions made of diecast aluminium.
Installation:
With stepped spacing ring made of ABS UL94-V-0 plastic for precise installation in the raised floor.
With trim ring and spring clip fixing for easy assemblage with various base plate magnitude from 10 mm. Made of die cast aluminium, the
component centres the grille insert and simultaneously secures it from twisting.
Air flow direction:
Without adjustable swirl unit for vertical air flow.
With adjustable swirl unit (ABS plastic, UL94-V-0) for vertical or horizontal air flow (factory settings can be changed). If required, the swirl vane can
be adjusted manually.
Dirt trap:
Without dirt trap, which can be used as a reduction element for volume flow balancing.
With dirt trap (ABS plastic, UL94-V-0) that also serves as a reduction element for volume flow rate balancing.
Plenum box:
Without plenum box for installation in pressurised floor.
With plenum box made of galvanised sheet steel; plenum box with Ø 123 mm spigot for connection to the air duct system. With incorporated air
distribution element for a steady flow to the floor diffuser.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs FBA
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
