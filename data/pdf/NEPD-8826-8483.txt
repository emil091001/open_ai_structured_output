Technical data:
The table below provides the average mass of 1 meter pipe section for a pipe system consisting of 6 meter pipe segments with couplings. This
information can be used to calculate the A1-A3 and A4 outputs for 1 meter section of pipeline by multiplying the values presented in tables on
page 7-11 with the mass of the pipe.
Furthermore, mass of 1 meter pipe section shall also be used to calculate A5 outputs according to the equation provided on page 5.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
This EPD is based on a life cycle assessment that has been performed on DN2000 and 6 meters pipe length. Additional assessments have been
performed to verify that the covered range of pipes are within the allowable global warming potential range.
For A4 stage, a typical transport distance of 500 km from the pipe production plant to the installation site is assumed. A project specific EPD can
be provided on request.
For A5 module a trench geometry has been calculated based on the diameter of the pipe. The trench depth is set to DN + 1/4DN + 1 meter.
The diesel consumption of 0,36 liter per 1 cubic meter of excavated soil is used. In addition, the consumption of 1.6 liter of diesel per 1m of the
trench length is used to account for material compaction and trench filling operations. It is assumed that 50% of excavated soil is replaced with
gravel. Transport distance for disposal site of unused soil and gravel from quarry is assumed to be 20 km on average.
Use stage (B) has not been declared since glass reinforced plastic piping, once installed, does not require maintenance.
It has been assumed that at the end of the functional life of the piping, the installation is either left in the ground or relined. Potential relining is
considered a second life stage, thus, all environmental burdens associated with relining are omitted in this declaration.
