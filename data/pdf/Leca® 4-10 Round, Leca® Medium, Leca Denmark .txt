Product
Product description:
The EPD describes results for production of lightweight expanded clay aggregate, labelled Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium , from the factory in
Hinge, Denmark.
Lightweight expanded clay aggregate is a granular ceramic material made from natural clay (see process information below). The main
characteristic of expanded clay is low density combined with high strength. Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium is used in lightweight blocks and
slabs, insulation fill, water treatment, lightweight fillings and geotechnical fills for thermal and sound insulation purposes. Thus Leca® 4-10 Round,
Leca® Medium is typically hidden in buildings or cast into concrete. The density of Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium is 0,305 tonnes per m3.
The thermal insulation is 0,095 W/mK. Further information or explanatory material may be obtained by contacting Leca Danmark A/S.
Product specification
The water content of the Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium is 0 % when the Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium is produced at Leca Danmark
A/S Hinge. The storage conditions can change the water content of the Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium up to 25%.
Different waste are recovered in the production process both as fuels as clay additives. See additional Tech info.
Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium is produced by using nearby clay and transported by using a conveyer belt to the factory.
Negligible amounts of packing material is used for raw materials and auxiliares received at Leca Danmark A/S so the potential environmental
impacts from packing is not included. Furthermore the final product Leca® 4-10 Round, Leca® Medium is sold in bulk, so no packing is used.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
