Product
Product description:
The FDR-3G fire damper is a fire protection device designed with compartmentalization to effectively prevent the spread of toxic gases, smoke,
and fire. Its versatile design makes it suitable for various applications, including residential buildings, industrial facilities, hospitals, and more.
Product specification
The FDR-3G fire dampers are available in various options and sizes.
Specific EPD data is provided as a reference for the FDR-3G-200-B230T model.
Correction factors for other sizes can be estimated using the table in the Technical Data section below.

Technical data:
Technical details can be found at the following link:
https://design.systemair.com.
To estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWPtot) correction factor for specific product size use the table below. For sizes not listed, calculate the
correction factor using the provided equation.
Each size has a specific correction factor. The correction factor is calculated by multiplying a coefficient by nominal diameter “DN” in millimeters and
adding the constant.
Equation for correction factors of unlisted sizes:
FDR-3G factor = 0,05553 * DN + 0,03150973
This equation enables you to estimate GWPtot correction factor for sizes not listed in the table. By using "DN" for your desired product size, you
can calculate the GWPtot correction factor.

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
