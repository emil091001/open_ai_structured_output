Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
Product stage – Raw materials A1
Lintex has long term relations with its suppliers, and a continuous dialogue about environmental performance when extracting and producing raw
materials and components.
Waste and energy use at the suppliers are included in A1, as well as production of packaging material.
Product stage – Transport A2
Transports are done by truck and/or ship from the supplier to Lintex manufacturing site in Nybro, Sweden.
Product stage – Manufacturing A3
Manufacturing takes place in Nybro, Sweden and includes cutting, painting, laminating, assembling and packaging.
From 2022 and onward, the factory in Nybro is a net producer of renewable energy, thanks to geothermal heating and 4400 solar panels installed
on our factory roof, producing around 1600 MWh annually.
Additional technical information:
Spare parts in the form of foot and wheels are available.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Installation stage – Transport A4
The main market for Mood Mobile is Europe, why a distance of 1200 km has been used as an approximation of transport from the factory in
Nybro to the end user.
Installation stage – Assembly A5
When arriving at the end user the products are unpacked. Environmental impact of the packaging material is included in A5. Mounting of the
product is done by hand with simple tools.
User stage - B1-B7:
In the user stage the product doesn’t consume any energy or other resources. Cleaning is done by a damp cloth. During normal use the product
doesn’t need to be repaired or refurbished.
End-of-life stage - C1-C4:
The end-of-life stage covers deconstruction, transport to a waste processing site, processing and disposal of waste. The LCA tool calculates this
based on material in the product and generic numbers, including an 85 kilometers transport to the waste management plant.
Beyond the system boundaries, Re-use - Recovery - Recycling -potential - D:
LCA-tool is calculating stage D potential based on material recycling and resource for energy production from materials if product end of lifecycle
would be in Norway. Material amounts are calculated based on the material used to make the product.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
