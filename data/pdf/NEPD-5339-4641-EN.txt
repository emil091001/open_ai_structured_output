Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Concrete produced according to the exposure classes X0, XC1 can be used for the following environments according to DS/EN 206 DK NA:
Concrete inside buildings with very low air humidity in heated rooms (X0), as well as concrete inside buildings with low air humidity in unheated
rooms or for soil-covered concrete foundations and terrain decks permanently in soil without flowing water or permanently submerged in water
(XC1).
This EPD is produced in agreement with Dansk Betons guideline "Vejledning til afgrænsninger for udvikling af EPD'er i Dansk Betons EPD værktøj".
These guidelines are made in collaboration with all members of Dansk Beton, who are using the EPD tool, and ensure a consistent procedure for
data collection and calculation across the Danish concrete industry.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
