Product
Product description:
The Sense panel is well designed and only 10 mm high. A narrow frame ensures attractive look and high efficiency.Sense can be mounted to visible
T-rail ceilings without accessories and to concealed T-rail ceilings, DAMPA clip-in ceilings, Troldtekt acoustic panels and Gypsum, and surface-
mounted using accessories. This makes Sense an all-round quality panel that can be used everywhere. Sense is available in several lumen
packages, phase-dimming or DALI depending on which driver kit is selected (accessory).

Cut-off criteria:
3 / 13
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) can be excluded. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = Transportation by truck (160 km) from the production site in Guangzhou, China to the harbor in Shenzhen, China. After this the
goods are transported by ship (19000 km) from Shenzhen, China to Bremerhaven, Germany. Then with a truck (650 km) from Bremerhaven,
Germany to the warehouse in Lillesand, Norway or to the warehouse in Mechelen, Belgium + 800 km for Nordic / Northwestern Europe Market.
Module A5 = Installation is performed in the Nordic / Northwestern Europe Market and done by manual labor, with the use of electrical machines,
that fall under the cut-off criteria of 1% and is therefore neglected. Packaging of the final product consist of a corrugated board box.
Module C1 = The de-installation of the luminaire is done by manual labor, with the help of electrical machines. The use of portable electrical
devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off-criterion of 1% and is therefore neglected.
Module C2 = Transportation from building site to the waste treatment facility with an average distance of 300km.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
