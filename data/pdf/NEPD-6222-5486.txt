Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = In A4, a transport distance from the production site in Vanvikan to Elektroskandia’s warehouse in Langhus was included. A distance
of 300 km was also added as additional transport to market.
Modules A5 = installation is done by manual labour. The use of portable electrical devices such as drills usually have low energy requirements
falling under the cut-off criterion of 1% and are therefore neglected (especially for small retail devices). No product scraps are generated during
installation, but the end-of-life treatment of packaging is systematically accounted for in this module.
Module B6 = The operational energy use of the switch is calculated based on the methodology provided in the PCR EPD Italy 012 Part B for
switches. To calculate the electricity use of the stove guard, the following scenario parameters have been applied:
- Power consumed (Puse) = 2.99 watt
- Reference service life (RSL) = 12 years
- Number of hours in a year = 8760 hours (according to section 4.2.3.5 of the PCR)
- Operating time coefficient (a) = 100 percent (according to section 4.2.3.5 of the PCR)
- Reference current = 100% (according to section 4.2.3.5 of the PCR – used to calculate Puse)
In our calculation, we have considered that the product draws current continuously, and therefore, we have used a reference current value of
100% in the calculation (instead of 50%). This represents the total load that the product imposes on the system during constant operation. We
include 3 pieces of AA batteries with the product, and have therefore also added the energy they deliver: Capacity 2.6 Ah × 3 pcs × Voltage 1.5 V
/ 1000 = Energy 0.0117 (kWh).
Module C1 = De-installation is done by manual labour. The use of portable electrical devices such as drills usually have low energy requirements
falling under the cut-off criterion of 1% and are therefore neglected (especially for small retail devices).
Module C2 = Transport from the installation site to the nearest waste treatment facility is based on an average distance of 300 km.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with energy recovery and
fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
