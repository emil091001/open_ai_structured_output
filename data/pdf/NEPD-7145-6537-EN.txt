Product description:
For extract air systems with demanding acoustic requirements and low airflow velocities
Rectangular VAV terminal units for the extract air control in buildings with variable air volume systems, demanding acoustic requirements and low
airflow velocities
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/vav-terminal-units/ta-silenzio-9eb320865e3d2dd7
Product specification
Rectangular VAV terminal units for variable and constant air volume systems, for demanding acoustic requirements, suitable for extract air,
available in 5 nominal sizes. High control accuracy even in case of unfavourable upstream conditions. Ready-to-commission unit which consists of
the mechanical parts and the electronic control components. Each unit contains an averaging effective pressure sensor for volume flow rate
measurement, a damper blade, and an integral sound attenuator. Factory-assembled control components complete with wiring and tubing.
Effective pressure sensor with 3 mm measuring holes, hence resistant to contamination. Both ends suitable for the connection of ducts. Casing
with acoustic and thermal insulation. Position of the damper blade indicated externally at shaft extension. The damper blade is factory set to open
position, which allows a ventilation airflow even without control; this does not apply to variants with defined safe position NC (normally closed).
Meets the hygiene requirements of VDI 6022, DIN 1946, Part 4, as well as EN 13779 and VDI 3803.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series TA-Silenzio.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs TA-Silenzio
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
