Product
Product description:
For comfort zones, with fixed air control blades.
Circular and square ceiling swirl diffusers that create high induction levels, for high room air change rates.
For more Information: https://www.trox.de/en/ceiling-diffusers/fd-53370f9ec5f33ed6.
Product specification
Ceiling swirl diffusers with square or circular diffuser face. Supply air and extract air variants for comfort zones, for a maximum air change rate of
35 per hour. Diffuser face with individually manually adjustable air control blades for horizontal swirling supply air discharge creating high
induction levels. For installation into all types of suspended ceilings. Ready-to-install component consisting of the diffuser face with radially
arranged, individually adjustable black or white set of air control blades and a plenum box, which is also square in the case of square faceplates (-
Q) and round in the case of rounded faceplates (-R). The plenum box has an equalising element for supply air. The plenum box always includes a
horizontally or vertically arranged spigot, cross bar and drilled holes or suspension lugs for suspension. The diffuser face is fixed to the cross bar
with a central screw, concealed by a decorative cap. Spigot suitable for ducts to EN 1506 or EN 13180. Sound power level of the air-regenerated
noise measured according to EN ISO 5135.

Cut-off criteria:
3 / 12
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
