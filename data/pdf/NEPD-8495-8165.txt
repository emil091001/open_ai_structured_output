A reference service life (RSL) as per ISO 15686-1, -2, - 7, and -8 is not declared. In this LCA an RSL of 50 years has been declared, equal to the
useful life of the building (according to standard 15804+A2), since the product is incorporated in the building structure.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The approach is “cradle-to-grave” but with exclusion of the use stage (B1-B7). Stage B1-B7 is not applicable for this cement based product. This
product does not require any actions or maintenance operations during the use stages. The following modules have been considered:
A1, A2, A3 (Product stages): Extraction and transport of raw materials, including packaging, and manufacturing process
A4 (Transport to market): Transportation from manufacturing plant to customer
A5 (Assembly): Installation at construction site
C1, C2, C3, C4 (End of life stages): Deconstruction, demolition, transport to waste processing, waste processing for reuse, recovery and/or recycling
and disposal
D (Benefits and loads beyond the system boundaries): Reuse/recovery/recycling potential
Additional technical information:
The waste code for unused product is 17 09 03* Other construction and demolition wastes (including mixed waste) containing hazardous
substances. See MSDS section 13.
Hardened product is not classified as dangerous waste.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A4 (Transport to market/building site): Most of our transports are from the production site in Linköping to customers in Stockholm. We have
therefore taken this distance as an average. This gives the value of 200 km. Transport method is Lorries (Trucks) in the tonnage range 16-32 t.
A5 (Installation): The product is used in a wet state, it is mixed with water at the building site according to specifications in the technical data sheet.
Application of the mortar is either by hand or with a mixer pump together with a plaster gun. Electricity for application with machine has been
taken into account in this LCA. Outputs are small amounts of waste from the product itself (assumed to be less than 5%) and waste from
packaging materials.
C1 (De-construction, demolition): The product is demolished together with the concrete structure. In this LCA we have assumed a scenario where
the product is demolished together with the whole building/facility.
C2 (Transport end of life): This stage includes the transportation effects of demolished waste to a waste processing area. The distance between the
demolishing area and a waste processing area is assumed to be quite short (less than 100 km). The distance varies depending on the type of
waste processing.
C3 (Waste processing): In this LCA we have assumed a typical waste scenario for concrete waste (cement-based products) that estimates that 10%
of the product is recycled. The product can be used as filling masses in for instance road construction. The most part is assumed to be put on
landfill (90%).
C4 (Final disposal): Mineral construction waste is categorized as non-hazardous waste. The product can therefore be used in landfills. The degree
of landfill and possibility to recycle the mineral waste is taken into account when disposing of the product. The degree of landfill is assumed to be
90% and the rest is assumed to be recycled.
D (Environmental costs and benefits of recycling and reuse): It is preferable if mineral construction waste can be recycled, since this would save
resources such as raw materials and also save energy during production. 10% of the product is estimated to be recycled.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
