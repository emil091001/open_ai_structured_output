End of Life (C1-C4)
Three different end-of-life scenarios are declared and
the results are indicated separately in module C.
Each scenario is calculated as a 100% scenario.
Scenario 1: 100 % landfill disposal
Scenario 2: 100 % municipal waste incineration (MWI)
with R1>0.6
Scenario 3: 100 % recovery in the cement industry
If combinations of these scenarios have to be
calculated this should be done according to the
following scheme:
EOL-impact = x % impact (Scenario 1)
+ y % impact (Scenario 2)
+ z % impact (Scenario 3)
with x % + y % + z % = 100 %

Recovery or recycling potentials due to the three end-

Recycling in the cement industry (scenario 3)
The organic material of the carpet is used as an
alternative fuel in a cement kiln. It mainly substitutes
for lignite (68.8 %), hard coal (23.6 %) and petrol coke
(7.6 %). The inorganic material is substantially
integrated into the cement clinker and substitutes for
original material input. VDZ e.V.

LCA: Results
The LCA results refer to all declared products with a maximum total pile weight of 1215 g/m2. LCA results for
products with a maximum total pile weight of 1000 g/m2 can be taken from the corresponding tables of the
annexe. Results for specific products with any other total pile weight can be calculated by using equation 1 given
in the annexe (see annexe chapter: 'General Information on the annexe'). The declared result figures in module
B2 have to be multiplied by the assumed service life (in years) of the floor covering in the building under
consideration. Information on non-relevant modules: Modules B3 - B7 are not relevant during the service life of
the carpet. Modules C1, C3/1, C4/2 and C4/3 cause no additional impact (see chapter "LCA: Calculation rules" in
this document). All these modules are declared and marked as 'modules not relevant/declared'. Module C2
represents the transport for scenarios 1, 2 and 3. Column D represents module D/A5.

comparative Toxic Unit for humans (not cancerogenic); SQP = Potential soil quality index
No substantiated values can be given for the SQP indicator with the existing database.
The result figures given in module B2 refer to a period of 1 year because a reference service life is not declared.
They have to be multiplied by the assumed service life (in years) of the floor covering in the building under
consideration.
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”.
This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the
nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or
radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from
some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential
for fossil resources”, “water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential
comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”, “potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential
comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”, “potential soil quality index”.
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are
high or as there is limited experience with the indicator.
