Product
Product description:
Super flat active chilled beam with two-way air discharge and horizontal heat exchanger, suitable for grid ceilings with grid size 600 or 625.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/induction-unit-for-suspended-ceiling/did642-68948a6014c7c89b.
Product specification
Active chilled beams of Type DID642, with two-way air discharge and high thermal output, providing high thermal comfort levels. For installation
flush with the ceiling, preferably in rooms with a height up to 4.0 m. The units consist of a casing with suspension points, a spigot, non-
combustible nozzles, and a horizontal heat exchanger. Five nozzle variants to optimise induction based on demand, including adjustable twin
nozzles, i.e. one pair of nozzles with different diameters.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series DID642.
The following represents a representative dataset of the most sold variant in the declared sales year

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
