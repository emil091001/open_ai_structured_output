Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

A1 includes the extraction and production of all raw materials used in the product.
A2 includes all types of transportation methods used for the raw materials to the production site in Anholt, Germany.
A3 includes the manufacturing and packaging process of the air handling unit.
A4 includes the transport to the market/user.
A5 modules not declared.
B1 - B5 no emissions are released during the use of the product (B1). Maintenance (B2) and repair (B3) or replacement of individual components
(B4) is not relevant during the service life under consideration (maintenance-free). According to the manufacturer, no renewal of the product is
necessary during the service life (B5). The modules are therefore labelled with "0".
B6 - B7 The model described has a manual drive and therefore consumes no electrical energy during the utilisation phase.
For this reason, the modules are declared as 0.
C1 - C4 includes the use of energy and other auxiliary materials required to demolish the building or construction in which the product is included,
transport from the building site to the waste processing facility, distribution of the product to different waste treatment methods and the disposal.
D includes energy and materials that have achieved a new function and are no longer considered waste.
Additional technical information:
Volume flow rate can be set using an external scale, no tools required.

No on-site test measurements required for commissioning.
Suitable for airflow velocities of up to 12 m/s.
Any installation orientation; maintenance-free.
Casing air leakage to EN 1751, class C.
Optional equipment and accessories:
Circular silencer Type CA or CF for the reduction of air-regenerated noise.
Hot water heat exchanger Type WL and electric air heater Type EL for reheating the airflow.
Actuator for variable volume flows or for qvmin - qvmax switching.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
