Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235, Disclaimer 1 – This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider
effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, radon and (from) some construction materials is also not
measured by this indicator.

environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is
limited experience with the indicator.
Additional environmental impact indicators (suggested by EN15804, table 4) are not declared in the EPD. The
results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
and as there is limited experience with the indicator (see International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD)
classification in EN 15804, table 5). For this reason, results based on these indicators are not considered suitable
for a decision-making process and are thus not declared in the EPD.
