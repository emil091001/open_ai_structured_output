LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m Hobas Sewer Pipe VO with coupling DN700, PN1, SN16000
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
This EPD is based on a life cycle assessment that has been performed on specified pipe product with coupling and 6 meters pipe length.
For A4 stage, a transport distance of 778 km from the pipe production plant to the installation site is used. Transport on EURO6 trucks and HVO
diesel is calculated in the table below.
Installation, A5 module has not been declared.
Use stage (B) has not been declared since glass reinforced plastic piping, once installed, does not require maintenance.
It has been assumed that at the end of the functional life of the piping, the installation is either left in the ground or relined. Potential relining is
considered a second life stage, thus, all environmental burdens associated with relining are omitted in this declaration.
