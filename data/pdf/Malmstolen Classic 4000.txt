Product
Product description:
The Classic 4000 belongs to the Individual series and is among our most exclusive and ergonomically advanced chairs. It features a knee-tilt
mechanism and a backrest with four elastic bands adjusted to your natural spinal profile, providing maximum support and relief. The unique knee-
tilt mechanism, in combination with the Dux seat, creates a balance that significantly enhances the user's freedom of movement. As muscle strain
is reduced, blood circulation is also improved, helping you stay alert and focused for longer periods. The Classic 4000 is available with a high or
medium-high back and can be adjusted for individuals with back issues or existing back injuries.
Perfect for those with specific needs, ensuring that your chair is always properly set up for you.
Product specification
The model studied in this declaration is the Malmstolen Classic 4000H, including packaging. The model declared does not include the neckrest, nor
armrests of any type.
The key environmental indicators for the other models of the family, and applicable options of the product collection are presented in a table on

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Malmstolen Classic 4000
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
3 / 13
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
