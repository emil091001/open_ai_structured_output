LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Oona benches
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
Product Stage / A1 Raw materials:
Martela has long partnerships with its suppliers and subcontractors, who buy raw materials to their products and components from their suppliers,
respectively. Main suppliers are locating in Europe.
Wood material is coming from sustainably cultivated forest (FSC, PEFC, etc) and fabrics can be chosen from our standard collection with Öko tex or
EU ecolabel certificates. Recycled materials are taken to use based on availability and when they fulfill the technical requirements set for the end
products.
Materials are including the product package to our customers. Packages that are coming from suppliers are re-used in customer delivery phase
(like pallets) or handled as waste in Manufacturing phase A3. Customer delivery package is disposed in Installation phase A5.
Product Stage / A2 Transport:
Transportation is calculated from suppliers location to our own factories in Nummela and Poland and between our factories when delivering
components to final assembly phase in our logistics center in Nummela.
Product Stage / A3 Manufacturing:
Martela has two own factories for manufacturing these products. Poland factory is producing sewing and upholstery parts to chairs and screens.
Production unit in Nummela make final assembly of the products based on customer orders.
Nummela factory is using renewable electricity and heating energy. From factory waste 98% is recovered. Poland factory is in rental premises and
cannot choose its used energy, so in calculation we are using Poland average factors.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Construction installation stage / A4 Transport:
Transportation from Martela logistics center in Nummela to our customers are calculated based on average transportation distances: in
Scandinavia 1100 km incl. by ferry 300 km (between Turku - Stockholm).
Construction installation stage / A5 Assembly:
Martela products are partly assembled at customer premises. This assembling is done with hand tools and use of energy is minimal in this stage.
Customer package is disposed in this stage automatically by the tool set-up, but our own installation teams take all waste back to our premises
and packages are re-used (like pallets) or recycled as materials (included in A3 waste).
User stage / B1-B7:
Martela products do not require special maintenance. Cleaning with for example vacuuming and wet wiping is advice accordingly.
Based on technical durability testing according EN standard in accredited testing laboratory Martela verifies use life of at least 10 years and grants
normal warranty for 5 years. Product use life can be extended with good maintenance and if necessary, by re-furbishing upholstery parts.
End-of-life stage / C1-C4:
LCA-tool is calculating stage C waste processing and disposal material by material for recycling and resource for energy production in Norway.
Material amounts are calculated based on the material used to make the product. Average transportation distance of 85 km has added for waste
management.
Beyond the system boundaries / Re-use - Recovery - Recycling -potential / D:
LCA-tool is calculating stage D potential based on material recycling and resource for energy production from materials if product end of lifecycle
would be in Norway. Material amounts are calculated based on the material used to make the product

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
