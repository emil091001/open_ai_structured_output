Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
3 / 12
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-cradle, A1-D, where some B-stages that were assumed to be neglectable are not included. The A1-A4 stages includes
the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, and an estimated transport
distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after the assembly at the customer. The only B-stage
that is assumed to be relevant is B2, which includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to Lammhults' care
instructions. The C- and D-stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management, the waste
processes, disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to
the capitol of each country sold/delivered to. An average distance (A4) to the customer has been calculated through this data. In the A5 phase,
the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts are added automatically according to assumptions made in the EPD tool on waste
handling on-site. In the use stage, the assumption is that the customer takes care of the product by cleaning the product with a dry cloth or a
slightly damp cloth with a few drops of very mild cleaning detergent. For the end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is a
50 km distance from the customer to a waste terminal. The rest of the values are automatically filled in by the tool. For the D-stage, automatic
values are filled in, according to generic data.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
