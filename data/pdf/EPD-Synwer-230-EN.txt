2.6 Manufacturing
The manufacturing is located at Synwer GmbH, Gierlichsstraße 23, 53840 Troisdorf, Germany. PP
fleece as well as film (PP) are already supplied and delivered as a finished product. The fleece is lami-
nated to the film. Prior to the lamination, the PU glue is melted in extruders and subsequently applied
to the fleece via slot dies. Subsequently a logo is printed on the product, and it is cut in size. If necessary
self-adhesive tapes are applied to the side edges of the side of the webs. Finally, the rolls are stacked
on reusable pallets and in packed in foil.
The manufacturing process is shown in the following figure:
Figure 1: Process flow chart of the production of Syn Sd 2/ 100
2.7 Packaging
Vapor barriers for interior and loft conversions are wrapped on a cardboard winding tube. The rolls
are than packed in PE film and stacked on reusable pallets, which are also packed in PE plastic film. All
packaging materials are recyclable or even reusable (pallets).
2.8 Reference Service Life (RSL)
The RSL of the product is strongly dependant on the RSL of the roof/building. If the product is installed
properly a RSL of 30 years can be assumed (BNB Service Life of Building Components).

3. LCA: Calculation rules
3.1 Declared unit
In accordance with the PCR B 1 m2 vapor barrier is chosen as the declared unit.
Product Unit Value
Declared unit m2 vapor barrier 1
Unit weight g/m2 100
Conversion factor to 1 kg - 10
3.2 System boundary
The EPD is a complete life cycle with a functional unit. It considers all potential environmental impacts
of the product from the cradle to the end of life. Table under LCA:Results provides an overview of the
information modules or product life cycle phases considered in the LCA. The manufacturing phase in-
cludes the production or extraction and processing of raw materials, the transport to the respective
production plant and the production of the vapor barrier. All inputs (raw materials, precursors, energy,
and auxiliary materials) as well as the by-products and waste are considered for all life cycle phases.
Finally, only production-related energy consumption (excluding administration and social rooms) is
considered.
The year 2020 represents the time reference for raw materials and electricity consumption. Due to the
production location Germany is considered as the geographical reference area. However, environmen-
tal effects such as the greenhouse effect can occur with a strong spatial and temporal offset.
The following production steps are considered during the manufacturing phase:
• Extraction and processing of the raw materials (fleece (PET), foil (PU), adhesive (PU))
• Transport to the production site
• Processing of the products (lamination, printing, cutting, rewinding, finishing)
• Packaging (including packaging material)
• End-of-life (including transport)
Secondary fuels are not included in the production process and are therefore not considered. The
waste materials and quantities produced are included in the respective modules.
3.3 Estimates and assumptions
All datasets chosen for the LCA refer to the EU as the geographic reference. Transport distances for all
raw materials used (raw materials, operating materials, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor
of 50 percent was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports),
which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used
for phase A2. For the end-of-life waste scenario 100% incineration has been assumed. The end-of-life
waste scenario per input material has been chosen and for each row material 100% incineration has
been modeled.
3.4 Cut-off criteria
All flows that contribute more than 1% on the total mass, energy or environmental impact are included
in the LCA. It can be assumed that the neglected processes would have contributed less than 5% to the
impact categories considered. All process specific data could be determined and modelled using data-
base references from Ecoinvent.
Page | 5 Synwer GmbH – Syn Sd 2/100
3.5 Period under review
All process-specific data was collected for the operating year 2020. The quantities of raw and auxiliary
materials as well as energy consumption have been recorded and averaged over the entire operating
year 2020.
3.6 Data quality
Overall, the quality of the data can be considered as good. In the operating data survey, all relevant
process-specific data could be collected. The data relating to the manufacturing, transports and pack-
aging of vapor barriers for interior and loft conversions for pitch roof and wall were determined by the
Synwer GmbH.
Secondary data were taken from the EcoInvent database, version 3.6 (2019). The database is regularly
updated and thus complies with the requirements of ISO 14044 (background data not older than 10
years). The background data meets the requirements of EN 15804. The quantities of raw materials,
consumables and suppliers used as well as the energy consumption have been recorded and averaged
over the entire year of operation (2020). The general rule has been applied that specific data from
specific production processes or average data derived from specific processes must be given priority
when calculating an EPD or Life Cycle Assessment. Data for processes that the manufacturer cannot
influence or choose, were backed up with generic data.
The selection of the best fitting data sets is based on research and the help of experts. The transport
distances for the waste treatments as well as the used environmental profiles for loads and benefits
are based on the data from the NIBE EPD online application R<THiNK.
3.7 Allocation
Allocations were avoided as far as possible. There are no coproducts or byproduct in the manufactur-
ing of vapor barriers for interior and loft conversions for pitch deck and walls. Based on energy
consumption measurements, the energy requirements of production were allocated to the individual
products. Recyclable production waste (PP and PE fleece) is collected and sold to the third party. The
production waste sent to incineration is modelled through the combustion process of the specific
material and the avoided conventional energy production is credited in module D.
3.8 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or assessment of the environmental impacts of different products is only
possible if they have been prepared in accordance with EN 15804. For the evaluation of the
comparability, the following aspects have to be considered in particular: PCR used , functional or
declared unit, geographical reference, definition of the system boundary, declared modules, data
selection (primary or secondary data, background database, data quality), scenarios used for use and
disposal phases, and the life cycle inventory (data collection, calculation methods, allocations, validity
period). PCRs and general program instructions of different EPDs programs may differ. A comparability
needs to be evaluated. For further guidance see EN 15804+A2 (5.3 Comparability of EPD for
construction products) and ISO 14025 (6.7.2 Requirements for comparability).

4. LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
For C1 it has been assumed that the product can be uninstalled manually by using hand cutting tools.
The end-of-life waste scenario per input material has been chosen and for each raw material 100%
incineration has been modeled under the consideration of suitable loads and benefits.
Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD
Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km; vehicle:
truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, it is assumed that only fossil raw materials are substituted, con-
sidering the calorific values of the raw materials of the declared product and energy and thermal effi-
ciencies of 18% and 32%. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits
are credited in module D.
5. LCA: Results
The following tables show the results of the impact assessment indicators, resource use, waste and
other output streams. The results presented here refer to the declared specific product.
Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IRP: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing ra-
diation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.

6. LCA: Interpretation
As shown in the figure below, A1 (raw material supply) and A3 (manufacturing) dominate in most
environmental core indicators. The highest impact among raw materiales is attributed to the fleece,
followed by the film. Lamination has the highest influence within the manufacturing phase (module
A3). The highest benefits beyond system boundaries (module D) orginate from the incineration of
virgin materials fleece and film at the end-of-life of the product. All transports (modules A2, C2) have
only a minor impact within all environmental core indicators.
