6. LCA: Interpretation
As process phase A1-A3 contributes most, the major
contributions within this process phase have been
further analysed and presented below. The graph
shows that major contributions originate from heat
production from natural gas at the production site of
Armstrong (dark grey; combustion emissions), the
production of stone wool (light orange; direct emissions
from production), maize starch production (dark green;
maize cultivation and infrastructure for processing) and
electricity usage (light blue; major contributor in the
electricity mix for Germany is electricity generated by
burning brown coal).
The graph shows the individual contributions of the
process phases to each environmental impact included
in the LCA of the Sahara 15mm Ceiling Tile. The graph
clearly shows that the module A1-A3 contributes most
to the environmental impact of all impact categories.
Next to Modules A1-A3, module D has a significant
contribution to the other environmental impact
categories. The cause of the relatively large share of
D, is the use of secondary material in A1 and the loss
of this secondary material at end of life stage, which is
compensated for in module D.
