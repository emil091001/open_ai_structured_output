Data quality:
The CEPE database is used as basis for the raw material composition. Specific data for the product composition and raw material amounts has been
provided by the manufacturer and represents the production of the declared product. Production site data was collected in 2015. Representative data
from ecoinvent v3.2 was used for other processes. The data quality for the material input in A1 is presented in tabular form.
