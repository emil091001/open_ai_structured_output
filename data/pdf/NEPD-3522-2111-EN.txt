apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In A4, a transport distance of 540 km from the Amokabel production site in Sweden to Elektroskandia’s warehouse in Langhus was included. A distance of 300
km was also added as additional transport to market. Installation on poles (A5) and removal (C1) is assumed to be done with other products and should be
assessed at a contruction works level. For B1-B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are assumed to be zero. Some other
potential environmental impacts from the use phase might not be covered by the scope of an EPD. In C3 metals such as copper and aluminium are sent to
recycling and other materials such as plastic insulation is sent to municipal incineration. Net benefit of material recycling and energy recovery is given in
module D. Both aluminium and copper will replace a market average process for the metals in Europe.
