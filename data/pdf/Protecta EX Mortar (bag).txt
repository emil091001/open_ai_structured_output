Product
Product description:
Protecta EX Mortar is a dry, white powder which consists of inorganic components and perlite. When mixed with water, the compounds form a
highly thermal insulating fire sealing compound to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through openings in fire rated walls and floors around
building penetrations. EX Mortar will also maintain the acoustic design performance in walls and floors.
EX Mortar expands approximately 1% by hydraulic action during curing to ensure a very tight seal around the service penetrations and
surrounding opening apertures. The mortar hardens to an off-white, dry compound of approximately 1050kg/m3 which may be sanded or drilled.
EX Mortar is suitable for most surfaces including concrete, brick, Leca, steel and plastic but is not suitable to fitting of doors or in service openings
that involve movement. No priming is necessary prior to application in most building substrates, however metal services in contact with the seal
must be corrosion protected.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Protecta EX Mortar (bag)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials and packaging, transportation
to the manufacturing site, as well as the manufacturing process itself.
Additional technical information:
Protecta EX Mortar can be removed with a hammer drill and disposed of at an approved waste facility.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.
