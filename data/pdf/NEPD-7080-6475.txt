Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​
Specific data for the manufacturing processes (product stage A3) refers to the year 2023. All other specific data is from year of study.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
NC Nordic Care AB, at our site in Tranås, we only use electricity from renewable sources such as bioenergy 49 %, hydroelectricity 27 %, wind 23 %,
1 % sun and 100 % bioenergy for local heating (figures from 2023).
The product is shipped to the consumer in Kinnarps’ trucks with blankets and cardboard sheets as packaging material which is returned to the
factory after delivery and reused. This method saves 270 kg of packaging material per container and enables 50% more products to be
transported in each truck. Kinnarps’ trucks have a load efficiency of approximately 87 % and are run on diesel with renewable content. For more
information about sustainability at Kinnarps, visit https://www.kinnarps.com/about-kinnarps/sustainability/.
The maintenance scenario includes vaccum cleaning of textiles once a week for the whole reference service life.
In normal use, no repair or replacement is required during the product's referenced service life.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
