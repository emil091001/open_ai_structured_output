Product
Product description:
GRAFT® FR Board is designed to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through openings in fire rated walls and floors where openings are formed
to allow the installation of multiple building services. FR Board will also maintain the acoustic design performance in fire rated walls and floors.
FR Board consists of a high density stone wool core, over-coated with GRAFT® FR Coating. The top coating provides additional protection by
significantly reducing the permeability of the stone wool core and prevents the passage of hot gases, thus reducing the temperature rise on the
unexposed side and reducing heat conduction through the building services.
FR Board is available with top coating on one or two sides, selected on the basis of installation considerations and fire resistance. On site, FR Board
must be used together with GRAFT® FR Acrylic for sealing around building services and the surrounding construction.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m2 GRAFT FR Board 1-S for Sweden
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-grave study, excluding the use phase (B1-B7). It includes the extraction and production of raw materials and
packaging, transportation to the manufacturing site, the production process itself, transportation to the construction site, waste management
during product installation, demolition, transportation to waste treatment, the waste treatment process, landfill of materials, as well as avoided
emissions and resource use in a new product.
A4: Transportation from the factory in England to Sweden is included. Additionally, 300 km of transportation from our warehouse to the
construction site is added according to the PCR.
A5: Manual installation is assumed, and electricity is not accounted for. No sealants/adhesives are included. Our fire-rated products are system-
approved and have EPDs for the necessary products. We expect the EPDs for the used products to be attached as documentation. 2% material
waste is included during installation. All packaging is sent for average waste management.
C1: Average datasets are used for demolition.
C2: 50 km of transportation to the nearest waste treatment facility is assumed.
C3: No part of the product is assumed to be sent for incineration.
C4: The entire product is assumed to be sent to landfill. The stone wool can be recycled if the paint is removed. However, we consider the likelihood
of this practice being carried out to be minimal.
D: Reuse, recovery, and recycling are set to zero.
Additional technical information:
GRAFT FR Board can be easily removed. If the product is undamaged, it can be reused. In case of paint flaking, it can be repaired using GRAFT FR
Coating.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.
