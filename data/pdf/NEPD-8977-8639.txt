LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Envistar Flex 360 with counter-flow heat exchanger and controls
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:

Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = A generic transportation distance (EURO6 truck) of 378 km is declared. True transportation distance can be provided in project
specific EPD.
Module A5 = Not declared.
Module C1 = The de-installation of the air handling unit (AHU) is carried out manually, with the assistance of electrical tools. The energy
consumption of portable electrical devices (e.g., drills) is typically low, falling below the 1% cut-off criterion, and is therefore disregarded.
Module C2 = A generic transportation distance (EURO6 truck) of 80 km is declared. True transportation distance can be provided in project
specific EPD.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 15804:2012+A2:2019 and EN 50693, Product
Category Rules for life cycle assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw
materials used in A1 will likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration
with and without energy recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.
