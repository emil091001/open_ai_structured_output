Functional unit: Development and verification of EPD:
Production of one chair provided and maintained for a period of 15 years. The declaration has been developed and verified using EPD tool lca.tools
ver EPD2020.11, developed by LCA.no AS. The EPD tool is integrated into
the company's environmental management system, and has been
approved by EPD-Norway
General information on verification of EPD from EPD tools:
Independent verification of data, other environmental information and Developer of EPD:
the declaration according to ISO 14025:2010, § 8.1.3 and § 8.1.4. Individual
third party verification of each EPD is not required when the EPD tool is i) Oddrun Innselset
integrated into the company's environmental management system, ii) the
procedures for use of the EPD tool are approved by EPDNorway, and iii) Reviewer of company-specific input data and EPD:
the proccess is reviewed annualy. See Appendix G of EPD-Norway's
General Programme Instructions for further information on EPD tools. Pawel Sosinski

Declared unit: Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects
1 Pcs Ergo Highback chair
of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
Transportation to an average customer in Copenhagen is 1000 km (A4: average European lorry > 32 tonnes)
The use stage (B1) is represented by a scenario and includes vacuum cleaning of textile once a month. The PCR does not
provide detailed guidelines for what should be included in the use stage. In the end of life stage, the transport distance for
waste to waste processing is 72 km (C1). The reuse, recovery and recycling stage is beyond the system boundaries (D). It is
assumed that the solution is dismantled and the materials recycled or combusted according to general Norwegian treatment of
industrial waste (see the table below). This calculation includes only CO2 emissions (GWP) in the C-modules. The transport
distance to reuse, recovery or recycling varies for each material, but the average distance is 373 km. The vehicles used and
associated data are described in detail in [5].
