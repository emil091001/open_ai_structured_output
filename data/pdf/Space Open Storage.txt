Product
Product description:
Space S2P800O in laminate finish with one wooden shelf. Underframes and wall hanging brackets available as options.
Practical open storage cupboard that offers a good overview of its contents. There’s a large selection of carcasses to choose from in different
heights, widths and depths. Link modules together to extend the width or stack them on top of each other to extend the height. Select both an
exterior and interior finish to get an organised and functional storage unit that’s also a well-designed solution. There are several underframes to
choose from, and with the help of leg reduction, you get a stylish and clean expression when several units are placed next to each other.

Declared unit:
1 pcs Space Open Storage
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The product is manufactured and assembled at our production site in Kinnarp, from where it is also shipped to the customer.
For the variants and options connected to this EPD, some metal components are manufactured at our production site in Jönköping. Some plastic
components are manufactured at our production site in Skillingaryd, where the fabric for the sound absorbent also is being processed. The
remainder of the metal and plastic components are purchased as pre-manufactured components.
The flow chart below illustrates the system boundaries of the analysis.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The product is shipped to the consumer in Kinnarps’ trucks with blankets and cardboard sheets as packaging material which is returned to the
factory after delivery and reused. This method saves 270 kg of packaging material per container and enables 50% more products to be
transported in each truck. Kinnarps’ trucks have a load efficiency of approximately 87 % and are run on diesel with renewable content. For more
information about sustainability at Kinnarps, visit https://www.kinnarps.com/about-kinnarps/sustainability/
The maintenance scenario includes wet-wiping once a week for the whole reference service life.
In normal use, no repair or replacement is required during the product's referenced service life.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
