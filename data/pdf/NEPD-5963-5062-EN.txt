Product
Product description:
Thatsit™ is an evolution of the iconic Variable. It is an ideal work chair for either the home or the office and is designed for seamless transitions
between different positions. It features a wider seat, a fixed backrest, adjustable in both height and depth, and adjustable shin rests. The wingback
is a perfect spot to rest your elbows or turn around and lean your torso against it for variation. The chair invites you to lean both in and back.
Thatsit™ is adjustable, allowing you to find the setting that best supports you. Thatsit™ is available in a natural or black finish and a wide range of
upholstery fabrics and colors. The wooden runners are made from layers of beech and ash veneer.

Reference service life, product
Longevity is incorporated into Varier's core values. Upholstery and cushions can be replaced over time and Varier products can be passed on to
the next generation. Varier offers an extended warranty of 7 years on wooden parts and 5 years on mechanisms. Lifetime is usually longer than 15
years.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Thatsit™
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
3 / 12
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
