Product
Product description:
Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LWA) is a porous, ceramic material made from natural clay. Organic matter is mixed
into raw clay, which is pelletized, dried and heated in a rotary kiln at about 1150 °C. The process expands the material into granules with 5x times
the volume of the original clay. The unsorted output material is sieved and blended into different grades of products, followed by distribution in
bulk og in big-bags. Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 has a grading of 4-10 mm and 290 kg/m3 dry bulk density.
Product specification
This EPD describes the performance for the production of Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 lightweight expanded clay aggregate, grading 4/10 mm,
produced at Leca Rælingen in Norway.
Intended use:
The primary uses for Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 is as thermal insulation layer, drainage material, LWA masonry blocks, LWA in site-poured lightweight
concrete and as soil improvement material. The material is suitable for geotechnical applications as well. Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 can also be used in
water management solutions for climate adaptation purposes.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m3 Leca® Lettklinker 4/10, Leca Norway
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The material has an indefinite service life and require no maintenance during its utilization. Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 can be excavated and re-used
in fillings in other construction projects.
Transport from production site to user (A4): Assuming 50 km transportation distance with a full size truck to the construction site. The weight of
Leca® Lettklinker 4/10 is low, and the loading capacity is therefore limited by the maximum transportation volume of the truck, not its weight
capacity.

Remarks to environmental impacts
The clay is excavated from a local clay fields that are close to the factories. Consequently, the production transportation (A2) emissions and costs
are minimized. After depletion all clay fields are remediated back into their original state, e.g. farmlands or natural areas.
Due to polluter-pay-principle, the emissions from waste are not included.
Biogenic carbon from biofuels are balanced to zero since they have their input and output in the same module.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
