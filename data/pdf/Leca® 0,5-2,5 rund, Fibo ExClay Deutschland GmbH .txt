Product
Product description:
The EPD describes results for production of lightweight expanded clay aggregate, labelled Leca®, Leca® 0,5-2,5 rund, from the factory in Hinge, Denmark. Lightweight
expanded clay aggregate is a granular ceramic material made from natural clay. The clay mixed with organic material, dried and expanded to 3-4 times its original volume
in rotary kilns at temperatures of about 1150 ° C. The output lightweight expanded clay aggregate granules, in the range 0-32 mm, are sieved and blended into different
grades of products and distributed in bulk or in bags.
The main characteristic of expanded clay is low density combined with high strength. Leca® is used for lightweight concrete, mortar, prefabricated lightweight concrete
products, lightweight fillings and other geotechnical applications. The density of Leca® 0,5-2,5 rund is 485 kg/m³. Further information or explanatory material may be
obtained by contacting Fibo ExClay Deutschland GmbH.
Product specification
Leca® 0,5-2,5 rund, natural expanded clay of various, precisely defined sizes and weights, is used as drainage and in lightweight mortars and insulating lightweight
screeds. It is also used by the processing industry as a lightweight aggregate for lightweight concrete.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m3 Leca® 0,5-2,5 rund, Fibo ExClay Deutschland GmbH
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small amounts (less than 1%) are
not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was used. The recycling
process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were collected for EPD
development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is
presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
