Product
Product description:
The Powerline wall box has a standard size, with two different fronts—one for single modules and one for one-and-a-half modules. The box can be
screwed directly onto the wall or mounted with a wall bracket if preferred. This EPD declares wall box without bracket. The conduit openings have
a sealing flap that can be pressed down with a screwdriver to open. The wall box has three openings on each side: two 16 mm and one 20 mm on
each side. It can be connected in series if needed.
Product specification
The products covered by this EPD have small variations in composition and are manufactured with the same type of equipment. The composition

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Powerline wall box w/o mounting bracket
Cut-off criteria:
All raw materials and all the essential energy are included.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming electricity and water are allocated according to measured
electricity consumption for the actual production department. Water is used for cooling and it is assumed that the amount of water for cooling
corresponds to the amount of energy used. Diesel and waste production in-house are allocated equally among all products through mass
allocation.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with option A4 transport to market. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials,
transportation to the production site, the production process itself and transport to the market. A5, installation, is included for the transport of
packaging waste from the construction site and the treatment of this waste - not the installation of the products.
Additional technical information:
Professionally executed design, storage, handling, installation and operations are a precondition for a long service life. The installation instructions
must be followed.
Pipelife Norway AS is certified according to EN ISO 14001:2015

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
