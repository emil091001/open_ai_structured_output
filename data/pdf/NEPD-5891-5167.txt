Product
Product description:
Lightweight expanded clay aggregate is a granular ceramic material made from natural clay. The clay is mixed with organic material, dried and
expanded to 3-4 times its original volume in rotary kilns at temperatures of about 1150 °C. The output lightweight expanded clay aggregate
granules, in the range 0-32 mm, are sieved and blended into different grades of products and distributed in bulk or in bags.
Product specification
The EPD describes results for production of lightweight expanded clay aggregate, grading 3-8 mm crushed, at Leca Kuusankoski.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m3 Leca®-sora 3-8 mm crushed, Leca Finland
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Remarks to environmental impacts
Due to the polluter-pay-principle, the emissions from waste are not included.
Biogenic carbon from biofuels are balanced to zero since they have their input and output in the same module.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
