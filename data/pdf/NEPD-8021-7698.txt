Product
Product description:
Filter wall type SIF for installation into ventilation systems.
For the installation of filter elements for the separation of coarse and fine dust.
For more information see:
https://www.trox.de/en/filter-wall/sif-15f228d5a3b2340c
Product specification
Filter wall type SIF for installation into ventilation systems. For the installation of filter elements for the separation of coarse dust and fine dust and
for the adsorption of gaseous odorous substances and contaminants. Filter wall consisting of standard cell frames with perimeter groove as base
element, installation subframes, and flat steel stiffeners. 4 clamping elements ensure secure sealing between cell frame and filter element. The
installation subframe is inserted into the groove of the cell frame and bolted into place at the corners. The flat steel stiffeners provide static
stability. Filter wall is hygiene-compliant according to VDI 6022.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs SIF
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
