2.1 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
ACETex® PET are engineered woven geotextiles manufactured with high-tenacity, high-
molecular-weight, and low-carboxyl-end-group polyester (PET) yarns. ACETex® PET
geotextiles boast a high tensile modulus and outstanding long-term design strength.
ACETex® PET is particularly suitable for applications involving soil reinforcement, including
but not limited to soft soil stabilization, base reinforcement, embankments on soft soils,
working platforms, and sinkhole mitigation, among others.
The following products are covered in this EPD: GT100-I, GT150-I, GT200-I, GT300-I, GT400-I,
GT500-I, GT600-I, GT650-I, GT800-I, GT1000-I, GT1200-I, GT1400-I, GT200-II, GT300-II.
2.2 APPLICATION (INTENDED USE OF THE PRODUCT)
ACETex® PET woven geotextiles are essential in soil reinforcement applications,
distinguished by their high tensile strength, low elongation, and excellent long-term
durability and creep performance. ACETex® PET excel in the field of soft soil reinforcement,
especially in regions marked by soils with low-bearing capacities. These geotextiles are

2.3 REFERENCE SERVICE LIFE
Once the inspection affirms the fabric's quality and integrity, it is then rolled to specified
lengths, packaged into paper tubes, and subsequently stored in the warehouse.
RSL PRODUCT
The RSL (Reference Service Life) of the geotextile varies depending on whether it is used
for temporary work or long-term applications, ranging from 1 year to 120 years. For
instance, geotextiles utilized in basal reinforced platforms typically have a service life of 5
to 10 years. Meanwhile, those used for piled embankments can possess a service life
extending up to 120 years.

A scaling method was used to calculate the LCA results for the different ACETex® PET

scaling there are results for both the fixed and the scalable part of the scaling function. 3.10 GUARANTEES OF ORIGIN
The fixed part means that this number is the same for each product in the product group
and the scalable part is the part that depends on the mass per unit area of the product. In In this EPD, the local based approach was considered for the LCA, therefore no guaranties

Method v1.0 are used. Long-term emissions (>100 years) are not considered in the impact
assessment. The results of the impact assessment are only relative statements that do not
make any statements about end-points of the impact categories, exceedance of threshold
values, safety margins or risks. The following tables show the results of the indicators of the

Disclaimer 1 – This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction
materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.

6 Interpretation of results
As shown in the figure below, the production process (A3) dominates in most
environmental core indicators, often followed by raw material supply (A1). In some
environmental core indicators waste processing (C3) has a great impact. The highest
influence on the Global Warming Potential (GWP-total) have production process (A3) and
waste processing (C3). Transports (A2, C2) have rather a minor impact within all core
indicators.
