Product description:
With low sound power level for comfort and industrial zones, with fixed air control blades.
For more information see: www.trox.de/en/4f0bbc8730a99cb3
Product specification
Ceiling swirl diffusers with square or circular diffuser face. Supply air and extract air variants for comfort zones and industrial zones. Diffuser face
with fixed air control blades for horizontal swirling supply air discharge creating high induction levels. For installation into all types of suspended
ceilings. Ready-to-install component which consists of the diffuser face with radially arranged fixed air control blades and either a spigot only or a
plenum box with side entry or top entry spigot, and suspension holes or suspension lugs. The diffuser face is fixed to the cross bar with a central
screw. Spigot suitable for ducts to EN 1506 or EN 13180. Sound power level of the air-regenerated noise measured according to EN ISO 5135.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs RFD
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
Circular and square ceiling swirl diffusers.
Nominal sizes 125, 160, 200, 250, 315, 400.
Volume flow rate range 4 – 330 l/s or 14 – 1188 m³ /h.
Diffuser face made of galvanised sheet steel, powder-coated, or of aluminium (depending on variant).
For supply and extract airFor variable and constant volume flows.
For all types of ceiling systems.
With discharge nozzle ideal for cooling in case of freely suspended installation.
High induction results in a rapid reduction of the temperature difference and airflow velocity.
Air change rates of up to 35 per hour can be achieved by arranging several diffusers in a row with a minimum pitch of 0. 9 m (centre line to centre
line).
Ideal for comfort zones.
Optional equipment and accessories:
Exposed diffuser face available in RAL CLASSIC colours.
Horizontal or vertical duct connection.
Plenum box with cord-operated damper blade and pressure tap.
Shallow plenum box.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
