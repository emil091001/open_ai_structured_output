Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = An average distance between the factory in Oulu and the Scandinavian market is considered.
Installation (A5) and removal (C1) is assumed to be done with other products such as piping systems and should be assessed at a contruction
works level.
For B1-B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are assumed to be zero.
In C2, a distance of 300 km has been added as average transport to nearest waste treatment facilities.
In C3, datasets are developed for the recycling of metals and plastics and for the incinerations of plastic fractions (including energy recovery and
fly ash extraction). All other minor raw materials in the product are assumed to be incinerated. Net benefit of material recycling and energy
recovery are given in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
