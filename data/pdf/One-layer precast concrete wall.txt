• Delivery of raw materials;
• Preparation of the molds (plywood formwork, cutting and laying of the probation steel ele-
ments, placeholders etc.);
Page | 3 AS BMGS - Precast concrete massive wall
• Concrete mixing and filling into the molds, curing;
• Removal of the formwork, finishing, storage.

2.7 Packaging
No packaging materials are used. The transportation does not cause any losses as products are secured
properly.
2.8 Production waste
The data on generated production waste is recorded as accurately as possible. Thus, the generated
production waste is allocated per declared unit. No loses for cement are assumed since filters are used
to collect dust in the air of cement storage in silos. The captured cement dust is reused in production.
No loses for inert materials are assumed too since materials are stored in open warehouses, which
three sides are enclosed by a wall. The same assumptions are made for other components. There is no
production waste for scrap metal, because reinforcement mesh, rebars and wires are delivered of the
size as in the drawings (no cutting is made).

3. LCA: Calculation rules
3.1 Declared unit
The EPD refers to the declared product system of 1 ton of precast concrete element.
Name Value Unit
Declared unit 1 ton
Cement type* СEM I 42.5R
Compressive strength class** C30/37- C40/50 -
Content of reinforcing steel 5,1 m%
Steel grade B500B / B500C -
* СEM I 42.5R is used for LCA calculations. Starting from 2022 AS BMGS intends to use also CEM II A-M (S-LL) 52.5
N and CEM I 42,5 N SR-3. Since the amount and the manufacturer of the cement used will not change it is ex-
pected to have less environmental impact in some categories (e.g. GWP - “global warming potential”).
** Concrete mixes are produced according to recipes, in compliance with the strictest quality norms and stand-
ards in force, as well as the specific purposes for which a particular batch of concrete is intended.
3.2 System boundary
This EPD was created in accordance with EN 15804 requirements and include the production stage,
transportation to the site and construction, and the end-of-life stage. According to EN 15804 this cor-
responds to product phases A1-A5, C1-C4 and D (EPD type "Cradle to gate with options, modules C1-
C4 and module D" (A1-A3, C, D and additional modules A4 and A5)). All inputs including raw materials,
primary products, energy and auxiliary materials as well as the accumulated waste are considered in
the assessment. The use of the final product is not within the manufacturer's sphere of influence.
Therefore, modules B1-7 have not been considered. The effect of CO absorption through the carbon-
2
ization process is not taken into account in the LCA. The reference year is 2020. The geographical ref-
erence area is Latvia.
3.3 Estimates and assumptions
The raw material data for each of the product produced is recorded to a high standard of accuracy and
precision. The energy consumption, ancillary materials and production waste is allocated according to
the annual production of the declared unit to the total annual production at the factory (incl. averaging
the obtained data depending on the proportion of the total).
3.4 Cut-off criteria
All material flows that contribute to more than 1% of the total mass, energy or environmental impact
of the system have been considered in the LCA. It can be assumed that the neglected processes in total
contributed less than 5% to the considered impact categories.
The product stage includes materials, energy and waste flows only related to production processes
(e.g. energy and water use related to company management and sales activities are excluded where
technically possible; production, manufacture, and construction of manufacturing capital goods and
infrastructure, other processes which are not directly related to the production of concrete elements).
3.5 Background Data
The background data is taken from Ecoinvent database version 3.6. (2019). The life cycle assessment
was modeled with the Rethink tool. Geographical reference space of the background data is Latvia.
Almost all consistent datasets contained in the Ecoinvent database are documented and can be viewed
in the online Ecoinvent documentation.
3.6 Data quality
In the operating data survey, all relevant process-specific data had been collected. The data relating to
the manufacturing phase of the precast concrete element are determined by AS BMGS and refers to
Page | 5 AS BMGS - Precast concrete massive wall
production sites in Riga, Tvaika street 27 and Ventspils, Fabrikas street 6. The data relating to the man-
ufacturing construction phase are determined also by BMGS and refers to the finished construction
project in Sweden.
Secondary data were taken from the Ecoinvent 3.6 (2019) database. The database is regularly checked
and thus complies with the requirements of ISO 14040/44 (background data not older than 10 years).
The background data meets the requirements of EN 15804. The quantities of raw materials, consum-
ables and supplies used as well as the energy consumption have been recorded and averaged over the
entire year of operation.
The general rule has been that specific data from specific production processes or average data derived
from specific processes must be given priority when calculating an EPD or Life Cycle Assessment. Data
for processes that the manufacturer cannot influence or choose, were backed up with generic data.
EPD of raw material (cement) was available, but could not be integrated as it was calculated according
to EN 15804:2014 (+A1) and not according to the EN 15804:2020 (+A2) standard used here.
3.7 Period Under review
All process-specific data was collected for the operating year 2020. The quantities of raw and auxiliary
materials as well as energy consumption have been recorded and averaged over the entire operating
year 2020.
3.8 Allocation
There are no co-products in the raw material supply phase, so no allocation methods were used at this
stage. There are no allocations during the manufacturing phase at the plant.
3.9 Calculation methods
For life cycle assessment, the calculation methods described in ISO 14040 have been applied. The eval-
uation is based on the phases in the system boundaries.
3.10 Mix of electricity and CO -Certificates
2
The electricity mix was chosen according to the energy grid mix in Latvia (reference year 2019). No CO
2
certificates were counted.
3.11 Comparability
Basically, a comparison or an evaluation of EPD data is only possible if all the data sets to be compared
were created according to EN 15804 and the building context, respectively the product-specific char-
acteristics of performance, are considered.
3.12 Reference Service Life (RSL)
The concrete composition limits given in EN 206 are specified for an intended service life of at least 50
years under the respective exposure classes/ environmental conditions.

4. LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
Module A4: This stage includes transport from the production stockyard to the construction site where
the prefabricated product shall be installed. Basic scenario transportation from AS BMGS production
sites in Latvia to customer in Sweden, Stockholm with distance radius around 100 km. Transportation
is calculated based on data form manufacturer and a scenario with the parameters described in the
following table. The transportation does not cause losses as products are secured properly.
Transport from production place to the construction site (A4)
Parameter Vehicle type Distance
Truck* Lorry >32t, EURO5 110 km**
Maritime Ferry/ Transoceanic freight ship, containers 270 km
* Data for transport is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips
** Total distance by truck: from Ventspils factory to the port located in Ventspils city (10 km) and from the port
in Sweden to the construction site (100 km)
Modules B1 to B7: For concrete components, maintenance and repair measures are generally not nec-
essary during the reference service life, so that no environmental burdens arise in these modules. In
addition, no energy or water is consumed.
C1 Demolition: According to the current state of the art, the demolition of concrete and reinforced
concrete structures is mainly carried out with longfront excavators equipped with demolition clamps.
The concrete buildings are demolished by so-called "press cutting", i.e. the crushing of concrete by
applying a compressive force. It is estimated that one site vehicle is in operation for 30 min per sqm of
concrete element (conservative assumption). In addition, based on Bozdağ, Ö & Seçer, M. (2007) en-
ergy consumption of a demolition process is on the average 10 kWh/m2 and an average mass of a
reinforced concrete building is about 1000 kg/m2. Therefore, energy consumption demolition is 10
kWh/1000 kg. The source of energy is diesel fuel used by work machines and based on the statements
above can be assumed being 1,009 l (with NCV 42,49 GJ/t).
C2 - C4 and D: It is assumed that concrete and reinforcement material are separated after deconstruc-
tion. For both waste groups, a waste scenario according to the Dutch National Environmental Database
(NMD) (SBK 2019) is applied:
• Concrete (i.a. elements, brickwork): 99% of concrete is recycled and reused as aggregate.
• Steel, reinforcement: 95% of reinforcing steel is marketed as scrap metal.
At the end-of-life, in the demolition phase 99% of steel and 90% concrete is assumed to be collected
as separate construction waste (C1). All of end-of-life product is assumed to be sent to the closest
facilities (C2).
The effect of CO absorption through the carbonization process in the use and end-of-life phase is not
2
assessed here and taken into account in the LCA.

Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IR: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing radi-
ation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.

6. LCA: Interpretation
The following figure shows the influence of the different life stages on the environmental core indica-
tors for precast concrete massive slab. Since the Global Warming Potential biogen (GWP-b) and Global
Warming Potential resulting from land use and land use (GWP-luluc) change have only a minor impact,
only total Global Warming Potential (GWP-total) is displayed. As shown in Figure 1 the majority of the
environmental impact is attributed to row material processing phase (A1), followed by the transports
of raw materials (A2) and production (A3). Results of processing phase (A1) theoretically can be ex-
pected lower since the supplier of the main raw material - cement, is implementing environmental
policy, for example, for cement manufacturing process different alternatives to fossil fuels are used,
as used tires, tire fluffy, NPS: Neutralized Polluted Soil (NPS) and Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF). In addi-
tion, this supplier owns the “Powered by green” certificate which confirms that the company is buying
electricity produced in Latvia from 100% renewable energy sources. But EPD of cement could not be
used because it is still calculated according to the old standard (EN 15804+A1), therefore secondary
data had to be used.

Overall, the quality of the data can be considered as good. The primary data collection has been done
thoroughly. Data quality was calculated using the Data Quality Rating method according to the PEF
approach. The DQRs range from 1,67 to 2,33 for the most abundant inputs in terms of mass.
