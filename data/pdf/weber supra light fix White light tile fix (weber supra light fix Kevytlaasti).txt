LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg weber supra light fix White light tile fix (weber supra light fix Kevytlaasti)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw materials extraction to product transportation to the building site, assembly as well as end of life stage and phases beyond
the system boundary (A1-A5, C1-C4, D) are included in the analysis.
The basic production process comprises of mixing raw materials together. Ready mixed product is then packed into bags for delivery. At assembly
phase, water is added according to the instructions and it is mixed. Stage B is not considered. Default waste treatment scenario from NPCR Part B
Technical - Chemical products for building and construction industry is applied: When building is demolished at the end-of-life 10% of the product
is collected for material recycling, and remaining 90% is disposed to landfill.
System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options, modules A4-A5, C1-C4 and D) are illustrated in the picture below.
Additional technical information:
Although 100% renewable electricity evidenced by Guarantee of Origin certificates (GOs) is used in the manufacturing process, national electricity
mix is used in this LCA.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The results of stage A4 (transportation of product) in the table of this EPD refer to transportation in Finland (average distance 2023). This product
may also be delivered to the countries in the additonal table "Transport from production place to user (A4)". In order to adapt the impact of
transportation to these countries, A4 figures from this EPD shall be multiplied by the multiplication factors below.
At assembly stage, it is assumed that mixing is done by electric mixer. Electricity mix used is that of Finland. Material loss is considered to be 0.
At end of life stage, it is assumed that 10% of demolition waste is collected and recycled, and 90% is disposed to landfill. Transport distance to
processing is estimated to be 50 km.
