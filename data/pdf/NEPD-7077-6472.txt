Product
Product description:
MDI based rigid polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation with foaming based on CO2.
This EPD covers products as material components, intended for use in various finished mixed products as e.g. pre-insulated piping systems, etc..
More information is found on www.pipelife.no
Product specification
The products covered by this EPD have small variations in composition and are manufactured with the same type of equipment. The composition
below represents an average for these products manufactured in 2022.

Technical data:
For products covered by this EPD the following applies:
Products used as insulation fullfill the requirements in accordance with DIN 4102-B3.
For technical information, see our documentation for the specific finished mixed product where insulation as covered by this EPD is a constituent
component.
Market:
Mainly Norway, but also the Nordic countries.
Reference service life, product
Predictions, based on long-term aging and thermal testing at average service temperatures covered by this EPD, indicate that the service life may
be up to 95 years. In practice, however, it can be expected that the service life will exceed at least 60 years. (NCBI / NHI, Long-Service-Life Rigid

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Component EPD Ringebu: PUR foam insulation from Ringebu - used as material component in various finished mixed products
Cut-off criteria:
All raw materials and all the essential energy are included.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and waste production in-house is allocated equally among
all products manufactured at Ringebu from raw materials, through mass allocation. The Ringebu factory has its own water supply. Water is not
consumed, it is used for cooling and then returned to natural flows. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with option A4 transport to market. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials,
transportation to the production site, the production process itself and transport to the market. A5, installation, is included for the transport of
packaging waste from the construction site and the treatment of this waste - not the installation of the products.
Additional technical information:
Professionally executed design, storage, handling, installation and operations are a precondition for a long service life. The installation instructions
must be followed.
Pipelife Norway AS is certified according to EN ISO 14001:2015

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
