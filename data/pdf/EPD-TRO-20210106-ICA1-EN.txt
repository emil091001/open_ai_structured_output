Within the cradle to grave, the following aspects have The clinker (cement) production is the most critical
been identified as major contributors, mainly in the process of the Troldtekt product system, but

 Emissions from the clinker production from Notably, by introducing more up-to-date LCA datasets
material for the grey cement applied, or introducing cements
with less carbon footprint into production could lead to
 Emissions from the clinker production from
significant reductions of especially the Global Warming

7.3 VOC emissions
7.1 Testing of substances used Testing for VOC emissions has been conducted in
A detailed assessment of substances used was accordance with EN ISO 16000-6. Analysis of the air
conducted by a DAkkS-accredited laboratory, based sampled on Tenax was performed at the Danish
