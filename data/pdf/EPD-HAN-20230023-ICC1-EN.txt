Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”.
This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing
radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not
measured by this indicator.

The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the
uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.
