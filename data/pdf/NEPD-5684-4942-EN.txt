Product
Product description:
For normal and high volume flow rate ranges and low-leakage shut-off.
Rectangular air terminal units for standard applications in supply air or extract air systems with variable volume flow rates, suitable for low-leakage
shut-off.
For more infomation see: https://www.trox.de/en/vav-terminal-units/tvt-2512f87247b59aee
Product specification
Rectangular VAV terminal units for variable and constant air volume systems, suitable for supply or extract air, available in 36 nominal sizes. High
volume flow rate control accuracy. Ready-to-commission unit which consists of the mechanical parts and the electronic control components. Each
unit contains an averaging effective pressure sensor for volume flow rate measurement and damper blades. Factory mounted control components
complete with wiring and tubing. Effective pressure sensor with 3 mm measuring holes, hence resistant to
contamination. Position of the damper blades indicated externally at the shaft extension. The damper blade is factory set
to open position, which allows a ventilation airflow even without control; this does not apply to variants with defined safe position NC (normally
closed).
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series TVT-D.
The following represents a representative dataset of the most sold variant in the declared sales year (TVT-D/300x200/BCO).

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
