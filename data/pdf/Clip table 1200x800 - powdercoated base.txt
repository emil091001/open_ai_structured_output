Product description:
Reference service life, product
The Clip table is designed by Komplot Design. The table is a functional
stackable table system. In addition the tables light weight makes it easy 15 years
to clean and re-furnish the room. Heavy lifting is avoided by pushing
Reference service life, building
the tables on one another and transporting them on an associated
trolley. The table system makes large meeting rooms, classrooms and
canteens as well as smaller meeting room. With it's elegant simplistic
shape and solid construction, the Clip table is a good choice for most
chair series. Table top is made of 19 mm poplar plywood core / HPL
laminate on top The table is a functional stackable table system. Stacks
8 tables with measurements 180 x 180 cm. Other Clip tables can be
stacked with max 10 tables. The table system can be delivered with
transportation trolley. Base delivered in polished stainless steel or
powdercoated

The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects
1 Pcs Clip table 1200x800 - powdercoated base
of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
