amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In A4, a transport distance of 387 km from the Prysmian Group production site in Sweden to Elektroskandia’s warehouse in Langhus was included. A distance
of 300 km was also added as additional transport to market. Installation in trenches (A5) and removal (C1) is assumed to be done with other products such as
piping systems and should be assessed at a contruction works level. For B1-B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are
assumed to be zero. Some other potential environmental impacts from the use phase might not be covered by the scope of an EPD. In C3 metals such as
copper and aluminium are sent to recycling and other materials such as plastic insulation is sent to municipal incineration. Net benefit of material recycling
and energy recovery is given in module D. Both aluminium and copper will replace a market average process for the metals in Europe.

LCA: Results
LCA results according to the indicators of EN 15804:2013+A1:2013 are presented in the following tables, for the declared unit defined on page 2 of the EPD
document. All potential environmental impacts might not be covered by the EN 15804 indicators. This concerns indicators such as noise, electromagnetic
