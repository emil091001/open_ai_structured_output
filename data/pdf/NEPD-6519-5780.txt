Product:
Product description:
Protan SE1.6 is a high quality polyester reinforced thermoplastic waterproofing membrane with high tensile and tear strength.
Protan SE 1.6 is used on exposed roof surfaces. The membrane can be mechanically fastened to the load bearing substrate or installed in a Protan
vacuum roof system. The membrane can be used on roofs of all shapes and sizes – whether flat, sloped or curved. The membrane is used on
warm/compact roof constructions as well as cold/ventilated constructions.
Product specification
Protan SE1.6 contains stabilizers which makes the product resistant to high and low temperatures, UV-resistant and flame retardant.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
