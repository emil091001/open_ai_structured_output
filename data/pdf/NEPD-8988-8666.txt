Product
Product description:
Starcon lifting systems offer advanced solutions for lifting, handling, and assembling concrete elements. Our range includes the Starcon Spherical
Anchor System, Starcon 2-Hole Anchor System, and Starcon Transport & Fastening Systems, all designed to optimize efficiency and safety in your
production. The systems include embedded parts such as transport anchors, fastening inserts, and wire boxes, which are easily mounted with
formers or holding plates. Once the concrete has cured, the elements can be safely handled with our reliable lifting devices, including lifting eyes,
ring clutches, and threaded wire ropes.
See more information of starcon products on: https://www.certex.dk/en/lifting-equipment/starcon-lifting-systems-c494208#
Product specification
Starcon anchors are designed to handle lifting capacities from 1.3 tons to 32 tons each, with dimensions ranging from 40mm to 1200mm.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The transportation to the market is assumed to be made by truck from the production site to the China harbor, by boat from the China harbor to
Danmark harbor, by truck from the Danmark harbor to warehouse, and truck from warehouse to the market. In the end-of-life module it is
assumed that 90% of the waste is treatment with energy recovery (C3) and 10% landfilling (C4). This EoL scenario is the most likely scenario for
steel products based on the national statistics (SSB, 2023).
