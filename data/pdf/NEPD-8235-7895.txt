LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Outlet Flush Mounted Double
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = Transportation by truck (160 km) from the production site in Shunde, China to the harbor in Shenzhen, China. After this the goods
are transported by ship (19330 km) from Shenzhen, China to Hamburg, Germany. Then with a truck (650 km) from Hamburg, Germany to the
warehouse in Lillesand, Norway + 800 km for Nordic / Northwestern Europe Market.
Modules A5 = Installation is performed in the Nordic / Northwestern Europe Market and done by manual labor. The use of portable electrical
devices such as drills usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off criterion of 1% and are therefore neglected (especially for
small retail switches). No product scraps are generated during installation, but the end-of-life treatment of packaging is systematically accounted
for in this module.
Module B1-B7 have been excluded since the product(s) covered by this EPD do not contain electronic components or due to the absence of clear
and standardized guidelines to calculate impacts during the use phase.
Module C1 = De-installation is done by manual labor. The use of portable electrical devices such as drills usually have low energy requirements
falling under the cut-off criterion of 1% and are therefore neglected (especially for small retail switches).
Module C2 = Transportation from building site to the waste treatment facility with an average distance of 300km.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with energy recovery and
fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the
end of a product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and
electricity generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
