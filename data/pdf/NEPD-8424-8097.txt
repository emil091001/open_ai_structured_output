Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

Remarks to environmental impacts
This square multibox fan uses electric energy for fan drive. The resulting environmental impact is highly project specific and vary depending on:
o Air flow
o External pressure
o Operating hours
o Electricity origin
o Etc.
Energy use are fundamental in determining the environmental impact of this product and must be calculated with project specific values, please
