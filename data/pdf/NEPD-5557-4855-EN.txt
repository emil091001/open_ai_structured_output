Product
Product description:
For normal and high volume flow rate ranges.
Rectangular air terminal units for standard applications in supply air or extract air systems with variable volume flow rates.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/vav-terminal-units/tvj-f8650873d3e5f5a2
Product specification
Rectangular VAV terminal units for variable and constant air volume systems, suitable for supply or extract air, available in 48 nominal sizes. High
volume flow rate control accuracy. Commissioning ready device, consisting of the mechanical components and the electronic control components.
Each unit contains an averaging differential pressure sensor for volume flow rate measurement and damper blades. Factory assembled control
components complete with wiring and tubing Differential pressure sensor with 3 mm measuring holes, thereby resistant to dust and pollution.
Position of the damper blade indicated externally at shaft extension. Damper blade open at delivery, thereby air flow also given without control
function; except variants with defined safety position NC.
Flanges on both sides, suitable for duct connection.
This EPD includes the environmental data of the product series TVJ-D.
The following represents a representative dataset of the most sold variant with controller in the declared sales year (TVJ-D/300x200/BM0).

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs TVJ-D
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
3 / 12
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
