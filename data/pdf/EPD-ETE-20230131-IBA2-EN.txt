EPD-ETE-20230131-IBA2-EN Production and installation of 1 m2 PROMATECT®-H RWS/HCM with a
thickness of 27.5 mm.
The EPD includes a conversion table to obtain the results for other
thicknesses of the respective product. Therefore, a linear relationship
between the thickness and the mass/environmental impact of the board is
assumed.
This declaration is based on the product category rules: Scope:

Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources”,
“water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”,
“potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”,
“potential soil quality index”. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these
results are high as there is limited experience with the indicator.
6. LCA: Interpretation
For PROMATECT®–H RWS/HCM fire protective boards raw materials in terms of environmental impact. With respect to
produced in China, the raw materials used in the formulation manufacturing, it is the energy consumption from electricity and
mix together with the manufacturing and the transport to steam that contributes the most. The transport to installation is
installation have the highest contribution on all impact significant as the transport from China to Europe has been
categories. Cement and hydrated lime are the most important taken into account.
