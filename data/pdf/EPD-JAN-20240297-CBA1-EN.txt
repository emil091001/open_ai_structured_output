LCA: Results
Results provided in this section are presented in relation to 1 m2 of door type Jansen-Economy 50 door (reference dimensions 1230
mm x 2180 mm).
For the End-of-Life stage, two scenarios are considered:
C3 - considers 100% recycling of metal system components (duplicated in D and D/1) and 100% thermal treatment of all raw materials
with heating value including plastic system parts. For mineral based components (i.e. gypsum board), construction waste processing
(shredding) and material recycling as filling material is considered.
C3/1 - considers 100% recycling of metal system components (duplicated in D and D/1) and 100% recycling of plastic system parts
(excluding e-waste sent to incineration). For mineral based components (i.e. gypsum board), construction waste processing
(shredding) and material recycling as filling material is considered.
C4 and C4/1 - consider landfill of all materials without heating value (except metals) including glazing and recycling losses from mineral
based components (i.e. gypsum board). Modules C4 and C4/1 are identical.
D - considers credits and loads from the recycling of the metal components and mineral based components (i.e. gypsum board) as
filling material (incl. benefits for the substitution of gravel (duplicated in D and D/1). Avoided burdens from packaging treatment
(duplicated in D and D/1) and thermal treatment of all raw materials with heating value (including plastic system parts/profiles) are
considered.
D/1 - considers credits and loads from the recycling of the metal components and mineral based components (i.e. gypsum board) as
filling material (incl. benefits for the substitution of gravel (duplicated in D and D/1)) and the recycling of the plastic system
parts/profiles. Avoided burdens from packaging treatment (duplicated in D and D/1) are considered.

PM = Potential incidence of disease due to PM emissions; IR = Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235; ETP-fw = Potential comparative
Toxic Unit for ecosystems; HTP-c = Potential comparative Toxic Unit for humans (cancerogenic); HTP-nc = Potential comparative Toxic Unit for humans
(not cancerogenic); SQP = Potential soil quality index
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator 'Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235'.This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators 'abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources', 'abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources',
'water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption', 'potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems', 'potential
comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic', 'Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic', 'potential soil
quality index'. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
as there is limited experience with the indicator. This EPD was created using a software tool.
