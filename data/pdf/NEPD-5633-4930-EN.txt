Technical data:
The torques for operating multileaf dampers must be dimensioned in such a way that the damper can be safely opened and closed.
For closure, the torque must suffice to ensure complete shut-off by the blades.
Opening is initiated without the impact of aerodynamic forces.
When air flows through the damper, the aerodynamic forces of the airflow create a closing force (torque) on the blades; this happens independent
of the direction of the airflow.
This closing force must be countered, or overcome.
The blade angle a with the largest torque depends, among other things, on the fan characteristics.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs JZ-AL
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
3 / 12
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
