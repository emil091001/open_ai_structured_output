curing, the product can be disposed of with household
waste. Full or only partially emptied cartridges must be
disposed of as special waste in accordance with official
regulations.
The outer packaging consisting of PE foil and
cardboard boxes designed according to the product
size can be recycled. Packaging contaminated by the
product must be disposed in a safe manner in
accordance with local/national regulations.

6. LCA: Interpretation
The dominance analysis shows that the main causes
of environmental impacts and indicators can be found
in the information module A1. This shows the global
warming potential for the provision of material with
about 90%, based on all information modules.
materials of the reaction resin mixture contribute
decisively to the respective environmental effects and
indicators. The material supply of the polyester resin
generates about 76% of the greenhouse gas
emissions. For cement, it is about 13% greenhouse
gas emissions. With aluminum oxide, it is particularly
striking that almost 100% of the ODP is produced.
Illustration: Dominance analysis A1- A3
In the information module A1, the material supply of
the reaction resin mixture causes about 84% of the
global warming potential. Approx. 6% of the
greenhouse gas emissions occur with PA6. Despite its
low mass, aluminum has a share of about 5% in AP.
Illustration: Dominance analysis A1, reaction resin
mixture
The mass of the individual components of the reaction
resin mixture come from the recipe information
provided by the manufacturer. According to the
manufacturer, this information can be assumed to be
highly accurate.
The relevant datasets used to calculate the material
availability of the product are highly topical (DE:
polyester resin: Thinkstep, year: 2018, EU-28: cement:
