2.10 Condition of use
No emissions are to be expected during the use phase of the
Heradesign acoustic panels because the ingredients are firmly
bound in the state of use.
Heradesign acoustic panels do not require any maintenance
from which significant effects on the environment can be
expected.
Cleaning is done by sweeping off occasionally. No effects are
assumed in Module B3 -Repair- because the repair of

The service life of Heradesign products is 50 years, but it
depends mainly on the life of the building. Due to the mineral
