Product
Product description:
Fully impregnated, planed wood from FSC and PEFC certified spruce (Picea abies), from Norway,
Sweden and Finland, for outdoor use above the ground. The wood is impregnated without the use of
heavy metals and organic solvents. The impregnation protects the tree completely into the core so
that the tree is protected against rot and fungus. The process takes place without the use of water,
so the wood is dry and can be used immediately after impregnation.
Product specification:
Main application area is outdoor cladding (in all known cladding profiles), but noise barriers,
windscreens, railings, roofing tables and more are other natural applications. The cladding boards
can be delivered with and without surface treatment from the factory. This EPD yields for
impregnated cladding without surface treatment.
The EPD encompasses all dimensions and profiles of the exterior of Superwood, with an untreated
surface.

Technical data:
Superwood has a density of 436,8 kg / m3, with moisture content of 16-20% (18% standard).
Superwood is protected from rotting, fungus and blue mold according to DS / EN 335, user class 3:
above ground contact. For Declaration of Performance (DoP), FSC certificate and complementary
information, see www.superwood.dk.
Standard dimension is 21 mm * 145 mm. Thickness of 21 mm is used in calculations. For 1 m2 of
covering cladding, 6,90 running meters of Superwood (dimensjon 0,145 m) is consumed.
Market:
The EPD includes transport to and sales in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Germany.
Reference service life, product:
Reference service life is 60 years according to PCR. The actual service life depends on climatic
conditions and external impacts, such as construction and maintenance.
Reference service life, building:
Reference service life is 60 years according to PCR. The actual service life depends on climatic
conditions and external impacts.
EPD for the best environmental decision 3
Declared unit:
1 m2 produced exterior cladding of Superwood, fully impregnated, untreated surface
Data quality:
Production data is based on consumption data from 2021. Wood is splitted, impregnated and
profiled in Denmark. For sawn wood A1-A3 LCA impacts (GWP fossil and resource use) are based on
EPD of Finnish sawn and planed timber (RTS_124_21), EPD of Stora Enso Classic Sawn (S-P-02150)
and EPD Moelven (NEPD-2546-1284-NO). Remaining data is based on Ecoinvent v3.8, allocation, cut-
off by classification (Nov 2021) and SimaPro v 9.3.0.3. Characterization factors have been used from
EN15804:2012 + A2: 2019. Ecoinvent processes are adjusted to improve representativeness (change
of electricity mix).
Allocation:
Allocation has been made according to EN15804:2012 + A2: 2019. For sawn wood, economic
allocation has been used. For the production of Superwood, all consumption and waste are mass-
allocated for the production of impregnated wood. Primary production of recycled materials is
allocated to the main product where the material was used.
System boundary:
Flow sheet for manufacturing (A1-A3) and transport (A4) of Superwood is shown below.

LCA: Calculation rules
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production process for raw
materials and energy flows that are included with very small amounts (<1%) are not included. This
cut-off rule does not apply for hazardous materials or substances.
Calculation of biogenic carbon content:
Sequestration and emissions of biogenic carbon is calculated according to NS-EN 16485: 2014. This
approach is based on the modularity principle of EN 15804: emissions should be counted in the
module in which it actually occurs. The calculation of biogenic carbon content and conversion to
carbon dioxide is done according to the NS-EN 16449: 2014. The contribution to GWP from biogenic
carbon is shown for each module under core environmental impact indicators GWP-biogenic.
370 kg / m3 dry weight for Superwood has a carbon content converted to carbon dioxide of 678,6 kg
CO per m3 wood or 14,25 kg CO per m2 wood (21 mm thickness). The wood is from sustainable
2 2
forestry and is FSC and PEFC certified.
LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD. All numbers
are pr m2 Superwood.
Transport from production place to assembly/user (A4)
All production normally takes place directly from Hampen to construction site or via retail. It is
considered a scenario of 200 km on a truck> 32 t. The A4 distance is calculated as average distance
for the Danish market. Additional distances estimated for other markets are given in the table
below.

Additional Norwegian requirements
Greenhous gas emission from the use of electricity in the manufacturing phase
For the manufacturing process (A3 Superwood) 100% renewable electricity from Danish wind power
is used in calculations. The renewable sources of electricity are evidenced by Guarantee of Origin
certificates (Miljøvenlig El, Energi Danmark).
Guarantee of Origin is valid throughout the validity period of the EPD. Documentation on certificate
is provided upon request to Superwood A/S.
National production mix from import, low voltage (production of transmission lines, in addition to
direct emissions and losses in grid) for wind power electricity production.
For assembly (A5) and de-construction (C1) national market mix from import, low voltage
(production of transmission lines, in addition to direct emissions and losses in grid) is used.

Additional environmental impact indicators required in NPCR Part A for construction
products
In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon contribution to climate impact, the
indicator for GWP has been sub-divided into the following:
GWP-IOBC Climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantanious oxidation
GWP-BC Climate impacts from the net uptake and emission of biogenic carbon from each module.
In addition, EP-freshwater shall also declared as PO4 eq.
