Product
Product description:
This terrazzo recipe is an example of a cement-bound terrazzo with stone size ranging from 0-25mm. The production takes place in several
production stages.
First comes the block casting, a casting process where crushed marble and binder are mixed under vacuum, then the mixture is poured into a
mould, the weight of the block is approximately 8,000 kg. After demoulding, the blocks are cured; the curing time varies depending on the
properties of the binder.
After curing, the blocks are placed in a frame saw for the production of slabs. The thickness of the slabs is determined by adjusting the distance
between the saw blades. Subsequently, the sawn slabs pass through a grinding line where they acquire their final surface texture. The finished
grinded slabs have the dimensions of 120x300cm.
The terrazzo slabs are cut and their edges can be polished to the finished product. The majority of the slabs are cut into floor tiles of varying sizes
and packaged in wooden pallets.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m2 Italien style 30 mm cut to size
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

1. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the
indicator
2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
