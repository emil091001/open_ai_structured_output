Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
3 / 13
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Remarks to environmental impacts
This air handling unit uses electric energy for fan drive and recovers thermal energy via a plate heat exchanger.
These factors are highly project specific and vary depending on:
o Climate / outdoor conditions
o Air flow
o External pressure
o Supply temperature
o Extract temperature
o Operating hours
o Electricity origin
o Etc.
Energy use and heat recovery are fundamental in determining the environmental impact of this product and must be calculated with project
specific values. This can be done using our AHU calculation software Blizzard, please refer to our website for more information.
