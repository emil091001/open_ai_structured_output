2. Product
2.1 Product description & application
Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak® is a floating underfloor system, specially developed as a load distribution
layer for all types of underfloor heating systems.
This unique system is an extremely stable subfloor on which many floor coverings can be glued directly.
Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak® offers a perfectly smooth and seamless subfloor, and the possibility of im-
pact marks in the floor covering is virtually eliminated. This system is therefore ideally suited for bond-
ing carpet, linoleum, design flooring and cork.
Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak® is the solution to quickly and easily create a very stable floor without cum-
bersome and time-consuming trowel work. By using Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak®, the floor is created
quickly, cleanly, dryly and very conveniently. Due to a very low thermal resistance, the heat from all
floor heating systems can easily enter the room. The floor is warm evenly and over a wide area. This
means that "hot spots" cannot occur in the first place.

3.2 System boundary
The EPD was prepared in accordance with DIN EN 15804 and takes into account the manufacturing
phase, the construction phase and the disposal phase as well as the credits and loads outside the sys-
tem boundaries. This corresponds to the modules A1 to A3, A4 and A5 as well as C1 to C4 and D. The
type of EPD is therefore "cradle to grave with options".
In this life cycle assessment according to ISO 14025, the following phases of the product life cycle were
considered:
- A1: Raw material extraction and processing
- A2: Transport to the manufacturer
- A3: Production
- A4: Transport to the customer
- A5: Installation
- C1: Deconstruction
- C2: Transport
- C3: Waste treatment
- C4: Landfill
- D: Reuse, recovery and recycling potential
For the declared life phases, all inputs (raw materials, intermediate products, energy and auxiliary ma-
terials) as well as the waste produced were considered.
3.3 Assumptions and estimates
For data protection reasons, the assumptions made and data used are only explained in the back-
ground report accompanying this EPD.
3.4 Period under review
All product- and process-specific data were collected for the operating year 2021 and are thus up-to-
date.
Environmental Product Declaration: Unifloor B.V. - Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak® | Page 6
3.5 Cut-off criteria
Potential environmental impacts were assigned to the material flows based on the Ecoinvent database
version 3.6. All flows contributing to more than 1 percent of the total mass, energy or environmental
impacts of the system were considered in the LCA. It can be assumed that the neglected processes
would have contributed less than 5 percent to the impact categories considered.
Other operating resources and the corresponding waste were not considered part of the product sys-
tem and accordingly not included in the balancing.
3.6 Data quality
To ensure the comparability of the results, only consistent background data from the Ecoinvent data-
base version 3.6 (2019) was used in the LCA (e.g. data sets on energy, transports, auxiliary and operat-
ing materials). The database is regularly checked and thus complies with the requirements of EN 15804
(background data not older than 10 years). Almost all consistent data sets contained in the Ecoinvent
database version 3.6 are documented and can be viewed in the online documentation.
The raw material data were converted into reference flows (input per declared unit).
The general rule was followed that specific data from specific production processes or average data
derived from specific processes must have priority in the calculation of an LCA. Data for processes over
which the manufacturer has no influence were assigned generic data.
The LCA calculation was carried out using Nibe's LCA & EPD tool R< THiNK.
3.7 Allocation
Specific information on allocations within the background data can be found in the documentation of
the Ecoinvent database version 3.6 datasets.
3.8 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or assessment of the environmental impact of different products is only
possible if they have been produced in accordance with EN 15804. For the assessment of comparabil-
ity, the following aspects in particular must be taken into account: PCR used, functional or declared
unit, geographical reference, definition of the system boundary, declared modules, data selection
(primary or secondary data, background database, data quality), scenarios used for use and disposal
phases and the life cycle inventory (data collection, calculation methods, allocations, validity period).
PCRs and general programme instructions of different EPDs programmes may differ. Comparability
must be checked. Further guidance can be found in EN 15804+A2 (5.3 Comparability of EPDs for con-
struction products) and ISO 14025 (6.7.2 Requirements for comparability).
3.9 Data collection
ISO 14044 section 4.3.2 was taken into account in the data collection.
The objective and the scope of the study were defined in consultation with Unifloor B.V. . The data
collection took place with the help of an Excel data collection template provided by Kiwa GmbH. The
collected data was checked by Kiwa GmbH, for example by critically questioning the assumptions made
by Unifloor B.V. . In this way, some errors (e.g. unit errors) could be corrected in cooperation with
Unifloor B.V. . Subsequently, the annual values were related to the declared unit of one square metre
with the help of corresponding calculations. In addition, suitable assumptions were made and esti-
mates carried out for the missing information and data.
Environmental Product Declaration: Unifloor B.V. - Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak® | Page 7
3.10 Calculation method
For the life cycle assessment, the calculation procedures described in ISO 14044 section 4.3.3 were
applied. The evaluation is carried out on the basis of the phases lying within the system boundaries
and the processes contained therein.
Environmental Product Declaration: Unifloor B.V. - Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak® | Page 8
4. LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
For the transport to the construction site in module A4, a scenario with a distance of 90 km and the
environmental profile "market group for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified {GLO}" from Ecoinvent
3.6 was used.
No auxiliary or operating materials or energy were taken into account when installing the product in
module A5, as only human muscle power is required for the installation. There are no direct emissions
into the ambient air, soil or water. But there is packaging waste in the form of protective film, which is
removed from the adhesive surfaces, and a Euro pallet, which was used for transport. As a conservative
approach, an additional 3 % installation waste was assumed.
For disposal, a waste scenario for "MDF" based on the NMD waste scenario ID 36 from the Netherlands
was adapted and used for Germany. Here, 5 % landfilling and 95 % incineration were assumed. For the
distance to waste treatment, 100 km for landfilling and 150 km for incineration were used with "market
group for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified {GLO}" (from Ecoinvent 3.6). The energy saving (credit)
from incineration was adjusted for the German market. For the landfill loads, "99% Waste wood, un-
treated and 1% Waste paint {EU}| treatment of, sanitary landfill" was used and for the incineration
"Waste building wood, chrome preserved {CH}| treatment of, municipal incineration".

5. LCA: Results
The following tables show the results of the life cycle assessment, more specifically for the environ-
mental impact indicators, resource consumption, output flows and waste categories. The results pre-
sented here refer to the declared unit of 1 m2 Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak®.
The results of the environmental impact indicators ETP- fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP, ADP-f, ADP-mm and
WDP must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or there is limited expe-
rience with the indicator.
The IRP impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionising radiation on human
health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents and oc-
cupational exposure, nor does it consider the disposal of radioactive waste in underground facilities.
Potential ionising radiation from soil, radon and some building materials is also not measured by this
indicator.

Figure 2: Shares of the product life phases in the environmental impacts for Jumpax® Basic / Heat-Pak®
As can be seen in the graph, raw material provision A1 dominates in the production phase in almost
all environmental impacts. Furthermore, it can be seen from the negative values that the credits out-
side the system boundaries in module D predominate.
For the "Eutrophication potential, fraction of nutrients reaching freshwater end compartment", the
credits from Module D (negative value) outweigh the sum of the loads from the other modules (posi-
tive values).
