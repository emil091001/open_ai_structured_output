Product
Product description:
This Environmental Product Declaration refers to organic coated steel profile produced by ArcelorMittal Construction Sweden. These products are
made of cold-rolled steel profiles for roof, wall, facades and floors applications.
The targeted applications are as follow:
-Roof & Decking
-Traditional wall
-Facade architectural
-Sidings
These profiles are available in different thicknesses from 0.5 to 1.25 mm. They can be covered with different metallic coating with masses from 60
to 350 g/m².
This EPD covers the following organic coated steel profiles produced by ArcelorMittal Construction Sweden:
-AM Galant 510, TP16, TP17, TP20 LS, TP20 OL, TP32, TP32R, TP45, Sinus 27 T, VP16, VP16v, VP17, VP20 LS, VP32, VP45, Sinus 27 V
Product specification
The nominal thickness of the profiled sheet varies from 0,5 to 1,50 mm. Low profiles with Magnelis is colled formed at the production facility and
the steel grade varies from S280-420GD and has a Magnelis® coating ZM120-350 (120 g/m² total for both sides, which allows the product to be
suitable in enviroments with higher levels of corrovisity (C4) due to its 3% magnesium content, Magnelis® coated steel offers self-healing on cut
edges and corrosion resistance in chloride and ammonia atmospheres.)

Technical data:
ArcelorMittal Construction Low profiles - Magnelis fulfills the requirement of the harmonized standard of EN 1090, EXC1 - EXC3, and is CE
certified (Certification number: 0416-CPD-7127-01). Performance data of the product in accordance with the declaration of performance EN
14782 with respect to its essential characteristics according to EN 1090.
Market:
The main market areas are the Nordic countries.
Reference service life, product
Low profiled sheets made of steel must withstand a term of protection of at least 15 years. The term of protection is the period until first slight
rnewals in the surface is requierd, only if there is no need of frequent inspections and service. the term of protection depends on the location,
weather conditions and the quality of the coating. Profiled sheets made of steel exhibit an estimated service life of 40 - 45 years depending on Life
Cycle Assessment.
Reference service life, building or construction works
As a structural part of the building, steel profiles are expected and specified to reach the same service life as that of the building, the lifetime
depends on specific applications as well as environmental conditions.

Type of EPD: cradle to gate - with options. All relevant life cycle stages are covered.
Modules A1-A5, C2-C4 and module D were considered.
The product stages A1-A3 include the following:
•Transporting and Receiving the raw material to the fabrication plant
•All relevant production processes in the plant including energy inputs, emissions and the electricity consumptions
•Waste processing until end of waste state or disposal of any waste residues during the production of TP-127 Magnelis
•Production and recycling of packaging
•Manufacturing of the Long span decking
The construction installation stages A4-A5 include the following:
•For the transport to the construction site an assumption of an average truck trailer of 16-32 tonnes payload has been taken into consideration.
Transport distance of the finished product to the customer has been estimated with approximate 300km. All values are based on annual average
delivery data
•For the assembly stage average values been taken.
The use stages (B1-B7) and C1 have not been considered in the Life Cycle Assessment.
The end of life stage C2-C4 include the following:
•Stages C2-C4 include average assumptions, provision for all materials and transports, and use of related energy and water
•lt takes into account the sorting and shredding of after-use steel, as well as the non-recovered scrap due to sorting efficiency, which is landfilled
•Packaging waste is recycled by the customers through their waste management system
Module D (Beyond the system boundaries) is included.
