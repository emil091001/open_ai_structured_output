Product
Product description:
Light expanded clay aggregate is a granular ceramic material made from natural clay. When fired in rotary kilns at a temperature of approximately
1150 °C, the clay increases in volume to 5 times its original volume.
The output lightweight expanded aggregate has sizes ranging from 0-20 mm, then it is dried and sieved through a system of sieves.
Depending on the application, an optimal aggregate mixture is prepared and distributed loose or in bags.
Product specification
The EPD describes results for production of lightweight expanded clay aggregate, grading 4-10 mm with bulk density 320 kg/m3, produced at
Leca Polska. The EPD shall also be used for all products with the same declared bulk density delivered in bulk: Leca® KERAMZYT 4-10 R, Leca®

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
