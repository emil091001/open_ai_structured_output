Product
Product description:
Lammhults’ early collaboration with the designers Börge Lindau and Bo Lindekrantz lead to many successful products. The second product group,
named X75, was introduced in 1972. Many of the pieces could be folded, such as the timeless X75-2, with steel tube frame and canvas seat and
back. The practical nature of folding furniture which allowed more compact living became an embellishment to the playful stylistic nature of the
Lindau-Lindekrantz design.
Product specification
Foldable frame of 25 mm chromium plated or powder coated steel tubing. Cross tubing always powder coated in black. Upholstery in black
canvas alt. natural linen. Seat with reinforcements in matching leather.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

The analysis is a cradle-to-cradle, A1-D, where some B-stages that were assumed to be neglectable are not included. The A1-A4 stages includes
the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, and an estimated transport
distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after the assembly at the customer. The only B-stage
that is assumed to be relevant is B2, which includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to Lammhults' care
instructions. The C- and D-stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management, the waste
processes, disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to
the capitol of each country sold/delivered to. An average distance (A4) to the customer has been calculated through this data. In the A5 phase,
the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts are added automatically according to assumptions made in the EPD tool on waste
handling on-site. In the use stage, the assumption is that the customer takes care of the product by vacuuming the product twice a year. For the
end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is a 50 km distance from the customer to a waste terminal. The rest of the values
are automatically filled in by the tool. For the D-stage, automatic values are filled in, according to generic data.
