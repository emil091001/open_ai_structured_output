Data quality:
The CEPE database is used as basis for the rawmaterial composition. Specific datafor theproduct composition and rawmaterial
amounts has been provided bythe manufacturer and represents the production of the declared product. Production site data was
collected in 2020, with 2019 as reference year. Remaining data is based on Ecoinvent v3.6, but adjusted to improve
representativeness. All energy consumption in the database is assumed not to be used as raw material.
Cut-off criteria: Allocation:
All major raw materials and essential energy is included. The Theallocationismadeinaccordancewiththeprovisionsof

Additional information:
The declared product contributes to Green Building Standard credits by meeting the following specific requirements:
-Criteria for Nordic Ecolabelling Building Materials Database
-Properties criteria in BASTA (2020:A2)
- The product contains no substances on the Norwegian Technical Check List (A20), which exceeds the limit value for health and
environment.
Additional certificates and approvals may be available on request.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The only declared module after the factory gate is A4 transport to market.
Transport is carried out in three steps, from production in Kolding to warehouse in Bollebygd and from Bollebygd to warehouse in
Oslo, as well as from warehouse to building site.
