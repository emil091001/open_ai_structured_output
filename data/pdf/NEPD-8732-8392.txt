Product
Product description:
GRAFT FR Pipe Wrap is designed to maintain the fire resistance of fire separating walls and floors when these are breached by plastic pipes,
conduits or metal pipes with continuous combustible insulation, and may be used in drywalls, masonry or concrete walls and concrete floors.
Each pipe wrap consists of a graphite based reactive intumescent strip, which reacts to heat and closes the opening left by the softening plastic
pipe or pipe insulation in a fire. The pipe wrap is installed completely around the pipes or insulation and secured with the self-adhesive tab. The
annular space around the pipe wrap is sealed with GRAFT FR Mortar or FR Board.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg GRAFT FR Pipe Wrap (pcs in plastic bag) for Sweden
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with optional modules A4-A5, C1-C4, and D. It includes the extraction and production of
raw materials and packaging, transportation to the manufacturing site, the production process itself, transportation to the construction site, waste
management during product installation, demolition of the building, transportation to waste treatment facilities, waste treatment, as well as
potential recycling, reuse, repurposing, or energy recovery.
A4: Transportation from the factory in England to Sweden is included. Additionally, 300 km of transportation from our warehouse to the
construction site is added according to the PCR.
A5: Manual installation is assumed, and electricity consumption is not considered. A 0% material loss is included during installation. All packaging is
sent to average waste management.
C1: Average datasets are used for demolition.
C2: 50 km transport to the nearest waste treatment facility is assumed.
C3: The entire product is assumed to be sent for incineration.
C4: Ash from incineration is sent to landfill.
D: Incineration generates energy for district heating and electricity production.
Additional technical information:
GRAFT FR Pipe Wrap can easily be removed and reused if the product is undamaged.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
