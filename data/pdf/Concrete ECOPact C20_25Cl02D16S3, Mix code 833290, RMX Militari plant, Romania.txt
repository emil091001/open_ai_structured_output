2.1 Product description/Product definition 2.5 Base materials/Ancillary materials
Concrete is produced by mixing cement, aggregates Name Value Unit
and water with potentially additional cementitious Cement ca. 10-17 M.%
materials, fibers and additives.
Water ca. 7-10 M.%
Aggregate ca. 70-90 M.%
The fresh concrete is generally poured into formwork,
compacted and hardened in the desired form by Cementitious ca. <1 M.%
hydration of the cement to form a solid artificial rock. Fibers ca. <1 M.%
Admixtures ca. <1 M.%
The declared product is unreinforced concrete that is
delivered to the job site as ready-mix concrete. In the
case of reinforced components, the proportion of
reinforcing steel must be taken into account
separately.
To calculate the life cycle assessment of the ECOPact
C20/25Cl02D16S3 concrete in plant RMX Militari, the
production data from mix code 833290 were used.
For the use and application of the product the
respective national provisions at the place of use
apply, such as the building codes and the
corresponding national specifications.
