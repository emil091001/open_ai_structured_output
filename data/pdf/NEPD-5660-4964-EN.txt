Product
Product description:
ABB SafeRing/SafePlus Switchgear is a medium voltage gas insulated ring main unit for secondary distribution. The main function of the
switchgears is to “establish and cut off the supply of a downstream installation from an electrical and/or mechanical control and to protect people
and premises at risk of fire or explosion against insulation defects”. SafeRing/SafePlus can be supplied in a number of different configurations
suitable for most switching applications in 12/24 kV distribution networks.
SafeRing/SafePlus 12 / 24 kV type CCV 20 kA Arc Classified switchgear consist of two load-break switch units (C-module) plus one circuit breaker
(V-module).
The manufacturer proclaims a minimum product service life of 30 years but the calculations are based on 20 years as the PCR dictates.
The functional unit of this study is described as 1 piece of SafeRing/SafePlus 12 / 24 kV type CCV 20 kA Arc Classified including heat loss during a
20 year product lifetime. The functional unit is IAC classified.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 2%) might not be included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through time allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:

Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804, Norsus, ecoinvent and other LCA
databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The product is assumed to be transported to an installation site in Norway in module A4.
B1 includes 0.1 % yearly leakage of insulating medium during reference service life, based confirmation certificate for the product.
B6 includes electricity lost through heat loss during reference service life in accordance with the PCR. Heat loss during service is based on the
resistance on the electrical circuit and 50 % loading relative to nominal current. This analysis is based on Norwegian electricity mix in B6.
The impact of removing the unit from it's place of usage (C1) to transport is assumed to be very low and is set as 0.
In C2 the switchgear is assumed to be transported to a waste treatment facility in Norway.
The waste treatment company has a process for collection and incineration of all remaining insulating medium in the unit. There is no leakage of
insulating medium during the disassembly.
End-of-life treatment scenarios for the product in modules C3 and C4 are based on the default values given in EN 50963 Annex G, Table G.4
