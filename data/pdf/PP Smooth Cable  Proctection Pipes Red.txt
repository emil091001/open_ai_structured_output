Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house
is allocated equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A5 = 5 % product losses during installation are estimated by the company. According to NPCR 028, other activities such as excavating/backfilling
trenches and other additional materials are not included, these are expected to be included at construction level assessments.
C1 = According to NPCR 028, other activities such as excavating/backfilling trenches and other additional materials are not included, these are
expected to be included at construction level assessments. This module can therefore be included with zero impact.
C2 = Estimated transport of product 100 km.
C3 - C4 =Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle assessments of
electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will likely be treated
during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy recovery and fly
ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life. The
benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by the
incineration with energy recovery of plastics is also calculated in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
