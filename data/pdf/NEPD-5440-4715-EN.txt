Allocation:
The allocation is made ​​in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials allocated to the main product in which the
material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

The maintenance (B2) of the panels is assumed to be performed by applying two layers of paint once during the life time of the panels.
Cleaning of the surface of the panels using detergent four times during the life time is also included.
In normal use scenario, it is assumed that there is no repair (B3), replacement (B4) and refubrishment (B5) is needed.

B6 and B7 do not have any LCA-related impacts. End-of-life life scenario, C1, C3 and C4, is based on
materials being separated on site. The steel is assumed to be
100% recycled and the mineral wool is assumed to be 100%
landfilled. Energy for deconstruction is included in C1, and
activities related to steel recycling is included in C3.

Moreover, the energy recovered is assumed to replace the local
energy mixes, Norweigan electrical and district heating mixes.
European district heating mix was used as proxy data to represent
the Norweigan district heating mix.
LCA: Results
The calculations are based on the Paroc AST E LEC stonewool sandwich panels. The deviation of the LCA results for the AST F LEC and AST
F+ LEC Paroc stonewool sandwich panels product range is estimated to be less than 4%.
Note that when interpreting the results, the benefiTs from recylcing of the steel in module D is calculated based on assumption of 100% steel
recycling.
