Product
Product description:
ABB SafeRing Switchgear is a medium voltage gas insulated ring main unit for secondary distribution. The main function of the switchgears is to
“establish and cut off the supply of a downstream installation from an electrical and/or mechanical control and to protect people and premises at
risk of fire or explosion against insulation defects”. SafeRing can be supplied in a number of different configurations suitable for most switching
applications in 12/24 kV distribution networks.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 2%) might not be included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through time allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804, Norsus, ecoinvent and other LCA
databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
B1 is not included, because it is a air filled switchgear.
B6 includes electricity lost through heat loss during reference service life in accordance with the PCR. Heat loss during service is based on the
resistance on the electrical circuit and 50 % loading relative to nominal current. This analysis is based on Nordic electricity mix in B6.
The impact of removing the unit from it's place of usage (C1) to transport is assumed to be very low and is set as 0.
In C2 the switchgear is assumed to be transported to a waste treatment facility in Norway.
End-of-life treatment scenarios for the product in modules C3 and C4 are based on the default values given in EN 50963 Annex G, Table G.4

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
