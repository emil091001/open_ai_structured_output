of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small Where virgin materials are used, emissions and energy consumption
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not connected with extraction and production are included.
apply for hazardous materials and substances. Where recycled materials are used in the product, emissions and energy
consumption related to the recycling process are included.
Emissions from incineration are allocated to the product system that uses the
recovered energy.
Emissions from incineration of waste are allocated to the product system that
uses the recovered energy.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
Specific manufacturing data are used. Raw materials by and large using EPD data, except for minor items like nuts & screws which are based on databases.

The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Transportation to an average customer in Paris, France is 1,850 km (A4: average Euro 6 lorry > 32 tonnes). The use stage is not represented currently, as it
varies very much, although the furniture as a rule require very little maintenance. End of life is represented by a dismantling and recycling of metals, whilst
wood currently is being sent to incineration. We aim to change this as well.
