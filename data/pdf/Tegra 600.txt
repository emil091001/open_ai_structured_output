The declared unit of this EPD is 1 kg Tegra 600. The results per kg are based on the product
‘Tegra 600 PP Cross 90° DN160 SW’ (‘base product’). The Table below provides the products
covered with this EPD. The selected base product is representative for all products described in
this Table; deviations of the LCA results of the other products compared to the base product are
not more than 10%.
The list below provides the mass per piece (including packaging). These masses should be used
to calculate the LCA results per 1 piece, by multiplying the results of all modules, except ‘A5 –
installation’, presented on page 10-13, with the weight specified below. The LCA results of ‘A5 –
installation’ should be calculated from the LCA results presented on pages 8-9 under ‘addtional
technical information’.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Tegra 600
Data quality:
For module A1, specific data for product compositions as provided by the manufacturer are
used. For module A2, transportation data of the raw materials used to the production site was
collected. For module A3, energy consumption and waste production data was collected for
production year 2020. The used background processes are derived from Ecoinvent 3.6.
Allocation:
Allocation was carried out in accordance with the povisions of the EN15804. All manufacturing
inputs (energy and auxiliary materials) at production site level are allocated to different
production processes, followed by allocation of the production processes to the products that
are produced using these processes through mass allocation. No secondary materials have been
used in the production process.
System boundary:
Modules A1-A5 and C1-D are included. The figure below shows a (simplified) process tree.
EPD for the best environmental decision 5
Cut-off criteria:
All relevant inputs and outputs - like emissions, energy and materials - have been taken into
account in this LCA. In accordance with EN15804, the total neglected input flows per module
does not exceed 5% of energy usage and mass.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Transport from production place to assembly/user (A4)

Truck 50% Unspecified 1086 0,027 l diesel/tkm
Boat 50% Ferry 113 0,0295 kg heavy fuel oil/tkm
Assembly (A5)
Product losses of 2% are considered. This product is used underground, therefore use of an
excavator, soil transport, and a gravel foundation are necessary. For the foundation, gravel is
used; this gravel is assumed to be transported for 150 km. The excavation of the soil is
performed with a hydraulic digger. It is assumed that most of the soil is backfilled; however, the
soil replaced by the gravel foundation and the pipe is assumed to be transported elsewhere
(150 km). The compation of the soil is considered negligible.

End of Life (C1, C3, C4)
Demolition is done manually, and therefore no energy is needed. The considered waste
treatment for the pipe is 70% recycling, 20% incineration and 10% landfill.

Benefits and loads beyond the system boundaries (D)
For the PP and additives, 0,67 kg of saved virgin PP was considered per kg material recycled
(total of A5 en C3). For the rubber seal, 0,67 kg of saved virgin EPDM was considered per kg
rubber seal recycled. The 67% is the considered quality factor, which means that the product is
at least three times recyclable. The benefits from exported energy were calculation from the
energy efficiencies for Nothern countries reported by CEWEP, which is equal to an electrical
efficiency of 11,0%, and a thermal efficiency of 72,6%. Energy recovery from all materials
(including rubber gasket and packaging) was considered. Substition of Norwegian electricity
mix and district heating mix was assumed.

Saving of virgin PP kg 0,31
Saving of virgin EPDM kg 0,002
Substition of electric energy MJ 0,81
Subsitition of thermal energy MJ 5,32
Additional technical information
Although most of this EPD can be scaled with the weight of the inspection chamber, this is not
the case for module A5 which scales with the diameter of the product.
To calculate the results for a specific product, the masses per piece, as described on page 3-4
(under technical data) should be used to calculate the LCA results per 1 piece, combined with
the data in the tables below. This should be done by multiplying the LCA results presented on
page 10-13 of all modules, except ‘A5 – installation’, with the mass per piece. The LCA results of
A5 – installation should be calculated from the LCA results presented in the table below.

Disclaimer 1 – This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on
human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to
possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities.
Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some
construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator

Additional environmental impact indicators required in NPCR Part A for construction
products
In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon contribution to climate impact, the
indicator for GWP has been sub-divided into the following:
GWP-IOBC Climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantanious oxidation
GWP-BC Climate impacts from the net uptake and emission of biogenic carbon from each
module.
