Product description:
For extract air systems with demanding acoustic requirements.
VAV terminal units for extract air control in buildings with variable air volume systems and demanding acoustic requirements.
For more information see: https://www.trox.de/en/vav-terminal-units/tvz-35c3e8c4d63bef09
Product specification
Rectangular VAV terminal units for variable and constant air volume systems, suitable for extract air, available in 6 nominal sizes. High volume flow
rate control accuracy. Ready-to commission unit which consists of the mechanical parts and the electronic control components Each unit contains
an averaging effective pressure sensor for volume flow rate measurement, a damper blade, and an integral sound attenuator. Factory-assembled
control components complete with wiring and tubing. Effective pressure sensor with 3 mm measuring holes, hence resistant to contamination.
Baffle plate is fitted after the damper blade for optimum acoustic and aerodynamic performance. Casing with acoustic and thermal insulation.
Position of the damper blade indicated externally at shaft extension. Damper blade is supplied open so that the air flow will be ensured, even
without the control function, except variants with defined safe position NC (normally closed). Meets the hygiene requirements of EN 16798, Part 3,
of VDI 6022, Sheet 1, and of DIN 1946, Part 4.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
