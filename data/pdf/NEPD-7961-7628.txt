Product
Product description:
Protecta Interior Paint FR-1 is a decorative paint with special properties to protect against spread of fire. It is a hard-wearing interior acrylic paint,
formulated to the highest specification and offering unsurpassed intensity of colour.
All colours are water-based and provide a smooth, rich and non-reflective finish. It is perfect for a contemporary look and to hide surface
imperfections. Interior Paint FR-1 is a one-layer system that normally requires no primer, no top coat, is easy to use and very easy to clean up.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Protecta Interior Paint FR-1 (pail)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
