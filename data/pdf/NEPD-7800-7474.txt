Product
Product description:
For high rooms, with adjustable air control blades.
Square ceiling swirl diffusers, with manual or motorised adjustment of the air pattern to ensure draught-free ventilation of the occupied zone both
in heating and cooling modes.
For more Information see: https://www.trox.de/en/ceiling-diffusers/vd-be1bf93e4f65b9ac.
Product specification
Ceiling swirl diffusers with square diffuser face for high rooms in comfort and industrial zones. For supply air only. Blades in diagonally opposed
sections can be adjusted for air discharge from horizontal (0°) to vertical (90°). Horizontal air discharge with high induction. For freely suspended
installation or for suspended ceilings of all types. Ready-to-install component which consists of the diffuser face with four equal blade arrays, a
cross bar for fixing the actuator, a plenum box with side entry or top entry spigot, and suspension holes. The diffuser face is fixed to the plenum
box with a screw. Spigot suitable for ducts to EN 1506 or EN 13180. Sound power level of the air-regenerated noise measured according to EN
ISO 5135.

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
