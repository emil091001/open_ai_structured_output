Product
Product description:
Protecta FR Graphite is a high specification mastic designed to prevent the spread of fire, smoke and gases through openings in fire rated walls
and floors. The mastic material expands when exposed to fire. It effectively seals openings around penetrations once any combustible or low-
temperature melting materials have burned away. It also seals difficult services which traditional fire rated mastics do not achieve, including large
plastic pipes.
FR Graphite can be used with a suitable filling material in order to ensure the correct width to depth ratio to reduce the shrinking of the sealant
during curing. Thermal activation takes place at 150 degrees when the material will expand to prevent the passage of fire and smoke for periods
up to 4 hours.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Protecta FR Graphite (plastic cartridge) for Sweden
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study, with options A4 and A5 for transport to the market and installation, respectively. It
includes the extraction and production of raw materials and packaging, transportation to the manufacturing site, the production process itself,
transport to the construction site, and waste management during product installation.
A4: Transport from the factory in England to Sweden is included. Additionally, 300 km of transport from our warehouse to the construction site is
accounted for, in accordance with the PCR.
A5: Manual installation is considered, without the use of electricity. A 3% material waste during installation is included. Emissions of VOCs during
installation are also accounted for. All packaging is sent to average waste management.
Additional technical information:
Protecta FR Graphite can be removed with a knife/scraper and disposed of at an approved waste facility.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
