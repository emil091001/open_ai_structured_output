LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

1. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the
indicator
Remarks to environmental impacts
The parameter GWP (A1-A3) includes 68 kg CO2-eq per ton cement, deriving from fossil combustion of secondary (alternative) fuels for the
production of cement clinker. In accordance with the "polluter pays" principle /EN 15804/, the emissions will be added to the production system
that caused the waste.
However, in this EPD, the CO2 contribution from components of secondary (alternative) fuels has not been deducted.
This is to be able to compare calculated global warming from cement regardless of the status of the waste in different countries.
The net GWP-tot is 710 kg CO2-eq.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
