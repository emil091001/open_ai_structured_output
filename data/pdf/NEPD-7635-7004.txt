Product
Product description:
Protecta FR Pipe Wrap is designed to maintain the fire resistance of fire separating walls and floors when these are breached by plastic pipes,
conduits or metal pipes with continuous combustible insulation. It may be used in drywalls, masonry or concrete walls and floors.
Each pipe wrap consists of a graphite-based reactive intumescent strip which reacts to heat and closes the opening left by the softening plastic
pipe or pipe insulation in a fire. It can be installed completely around the pipes or insulation and secured with the self adhesive tab. The annular
space around the pipe wrap is to be sealed with EX Mortar or FR Board.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Protecta FR Pipe Wrap (roll in box)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials and packaging, transportation
to the manufacturing site, as well as the manufacturing process itself.
Additional technical information:
Protecta FR Pipe Wrap can be reused if the product is undamaged.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.
