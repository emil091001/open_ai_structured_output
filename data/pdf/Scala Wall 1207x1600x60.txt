Product
Product description:
Scala Wall is an acoustic panel that is mounted on the wall. The design of the sound-absorbent Scala is not only developed for visual reasons, but
primarily to contribute to a softer soundscape. The wall-mounted version of Scala is available in different sizes. Portrait or landscape format, to be
hung on hidden wall brackets. For more information about the product, visit the product page https://abstracta.se/product/scala-wall-sound-
absorbing-panels/.
Product specification
The modules are made from compressed polyester with or without fabric. It is hung on the wall with concealed aluminium brackets.

Technical data:
The dimensions of Scala Wall 190 530 00 are 1207x1600x60, but other sizes are also available. This EPD is made for a Scala Wall without fabric,
but with fabric is also available. Note that adding this, changes the environmental impact of the product.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-grave, A1-D, where some B-stages (use phase) that were assumed to be neglectable are not included. The A1-A4 stages
includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself and an estimated
transport distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after assembly at the customer. The only B
stage that is assumed to be relevant is B2, which includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to Abstracta's
care instructions. The C and D stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management, the waste
processes, disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.
Additional technical information:
To preserve the fabric colour and the appearance of the fabric, Scala should be vacuumed regularly with a soft nozzle.
Polyester Stain Removal: Use uncoloured paper towel or cloth to soak up as much as possible of the stain. Dried stains should be vacuumed.
Moisten the stain lightly with a clean white cotton cloth, lukewarm water and possibly a small amount of pH-neutral detergent. Press a dry cloth
or uncoloured paper towel against the fabric so that moisture and dirt are absorbed. Repeat moistening and soaking until the stain is gone. Use
clean water without detergent at the last moistening. Finish with soaking.
Wool Stain Removal: Dab or wipe gently with a moist cloth.
Abstracta offers a take-back scheme for used products that our customers want to reuse or recycle. We can then reuse the components in the
best, possible way. In this way, we can save some of the world’s resources by reusing or refurbishing some products to avoid throwing away fully
functional material or products. In cases where this is not possible, we instead recycle the materials in the best possible way. Read more about this
here: https://abstracta.se/story/abstracta-is-introducing-a-new-recycling-service-for-used-products-abstracta/. Otherwise, try to ensure that the
product can be reused when possible, or else, dismantle it so that as much of the materials can be recycled as possible.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to a
customer in Scandinavia, the UK or France (about 85% of sales in 2022). An average distance to the customer has been calculated through this
data. In the construction phase (A5), the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts were added automatically according to
assumptions made in the EPD tool on waste handling by the customer or installer of the product. In the use stage the assumption is that the
customer takes care of the product by vacuuming it on a yearly basis. For the end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is
50 km from the customer to the waste terminal. The rest of the values for this stage are automatically filled in by the tool, according to other
assumptions of disposal and waste processes. For the D-stage, where negative impacts from recycling and heat generation from waste
incineration are added, automatic values are filled in, according to generic data.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

Additional Environmental Information
Additional environmental impact indicators required in NPCR Part A for construction products
Indicator Unit A1-A3 A4 A5 B2 B3
GWPIOBC kg CO2 -eq 1,60E+01 7,00E-01 0,00E+00 1,10E-02 0
Indicator Unit B4 C1 C2 C3 C4 D
GWPIOBC kg CO2 -eq 0 0 6,79E-02 1,04E+01 6,48E-03 -9,61E-01
GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
