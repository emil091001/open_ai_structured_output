LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:

Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The product is shipped to the consumer in Kinnarps’ trucks with blankets and cardboard sheets as packaging material which is returned to the
factory after delivery and reused. This method saves 270 kg of packaging material per container and enables 50% more products to be
transported in each truck. Kinnarps’ trucks have a load efficiency of approximately 87 % and are run on diesel with renewable content. For more
information about sustainability at Kinnarps, visit https://www.kinnarps.com/about-kinnarps/sustainability/
The maintenance scenario includes wet-wiping once a week for the whole reference service life.
In normal use, no repair or replacement is required during the product's referenced service life.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
