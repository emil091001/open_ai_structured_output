Product
Product description:
Biokalk 75 is a dust free liquid suspension of liming material. Adding Biokalk 75 improves availability of mineral nutrients of the manure. Biokalk 75
reduces the risks of pollution of groundwater and rivers by nitrates and phosphates. Biokalk 75 also decreases air pollutants and nauseating
smells, and reduces nitrogen monoxide emissions, which contributes to the greenhouse effect.
Product specification
High-quality, natural mineral to condition and enrich crop soil. Biokalk 75 is produced to guarantee screen specifications that meet agriculture
requirements.
Materials Value Unit
Stone 48-80 %
Water 20-52 %
Additives 0-2 %

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The impacts of stone extraction are
allocated among the many products manufactured by Omya Hustadmarmor AS.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 contains transport with a tanker ship and truck to rivers and municipalities around the region of Stavanger, Norway. An average
distance is included.
Modules C and D are not relevant for this product, as it fulfills the three criteria described by EN 15804+A2:2019, namely: 1) the product is
physically integrated with soil or water during installation so it cannot be physically retrieved at end of life; 2) The product is no longer identifiable
at end of life as a result of a physical or chemical transformation process; and 3) The product does not contain biogenic carbon.
