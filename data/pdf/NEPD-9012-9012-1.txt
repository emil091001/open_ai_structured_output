Product
Product description:
Planipatch Xtra Zero is a grey powder made from special cement binders, selected graded aggregates and synthetic additives. When mixed with
water, Planipatch Xtra Zero forms a thixotropic paste with good workability and high bonding strength to the substrate. Thanks to the very fine
texture, it can be applied down to a “feather-edge” in order to obtain an even and closed surface. The special binders allow to model and smooth
the patching compound quickly, in order to obtain the required surface. When used as a patching compound or for local repairing, Planipatch Xtra
Zero can be used in thicknesses from 0 to 50 mm. Planipatch Xtra Zero reaches a very high level of mechanical strength and resistance to impact
and abrasion. Substrates skimmed or smoothed over with Planipatch Xtra Zero have a very smooth, fine-textured finish, particularly suitable for
resilient floor coverings. Planipatch Xtra Zero is available in 15kg bags and 5kg alu-pack.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Planipatch Xtra Zero
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The approach is “cradle to gate” (A1–A3) with modules C1–C4 and module D and optional modules (A1–A3 + A4 – A5 + C + D). The production
process starts from raw materials, that are purchased from external and intercompany suppliers and stored in the plant. Bulk raw materials are
stored in specific silos and added automatically in the production mixer, according to the formula of the product. Other raw materials, supplied in
bags, big bags or tanks, are stored in the warehouse and added automatically or manually in the mixer. The production is a discontinuous process,
in which all the components are mechanically mixed in batches. The semi-finished product is then packaged, put on wooden pallets and stored in
the finished products warehouse. The quality of final products is controlled before the sale.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The results of stage A4 in the table of this EPD refer to domestic transport set by the PCR. This product may also be delivered to the countries in
the table "Additional A4 information". To calculate the GWP of transportation to these countries, the result GWPtot of module A4 from this EPD
shall be multiplied by the multiplication factors below. The installation phase (A5) includes the water to be added and the electricity consumption
for mixing. The packaging is collected and sent to treatment. The demolition phase (C1) includes the electricity for demolition. The transport of
waste is carried out by truck over 100 km (C2). It is assumed that 30% of the product is disposed into landfill and 70% is collected and recycled.
Module D contains credits from the recycling of the fraction of product in module C3, at the end of life, the product can be collected and recycled
for use in substitution of virgin raw aggregates.
