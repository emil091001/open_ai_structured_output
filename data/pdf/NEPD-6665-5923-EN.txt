Product
Product description:
The insulation board is provided in several dimensions and thicknesses. Please use the conversion table below for other sizes than the declared
unit. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings and constructions. As most of the material is air,
EPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life and
high compressive strength. This LCA is based on EPS 120 Routa and can be used for all products with the conversion factor which can be found
under System boundaries
Product specification
EPS beads expand up to 40 times when exposed to steam. The expanded polystyrene beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where
steam and pressure form large blocks of EPS. During these processes, the final density of the product is determined. EPS density is the main
contributor to the mechanical and thermal resistances of EPS. The average density of EPS Routa 120 is around 21 kg/m³.

Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The allocation is made in accordance

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
