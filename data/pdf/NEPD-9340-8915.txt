LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Lyssand 120 Balcony door wood, 1230x2180
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The PCR specific
background data follow the allocation rules in the Ecoinvent v3.7.1 Cut-off database version. The allocation of water, energy and waste flows
within the production facilities for windows and doors follows unit-based allocation adjusted with a point system to different product groups or
products. This score system is regulated by a factor which increases with the resource intensity of each product. The unit-based allocation is
adjusted by the weight of the product, excluding the weight of glass.
Data quality:
3 / 13
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A4
Transportation is assumed at 300km from factory site in Frekhaug, Norway. Transported using a large EURO 6 truck with delivery directly to
construction site.
A5
As the product installation can vary from different construction sites, height of the building and other unknown factors, the installation is assumed
to be done manually and no other parameters are considered for this calculation. Waste treatment of packaging is included in the EPD
calculations.
B2/B3
Maintenance is included as cleaning 3 times pr year and lubricating metal parts. For products with 40 year RSL, the whole product will need
replacing once during the buildings RSL, it is assumed that this will happen after 30 years when the IGU reaches its end of life. No repairs are
assumed during RSL.
B4/B5
The products reference service life (RSL) is estimatet at 40 years, there is assumed one replacement of the whole window during RSL.
B6
The product has no operational energy use.
C1
It is assumed that the product will be manually deconstructed for recycling and waste, hence no energy usage is assumed for this. The product is
assumed to be treated as mixed waste and sent to incineration. Glass is assumed to go to landfill and metals are sorted from the ash and recycled.
C2
It is assumed a transport from deconstruction to waste/incineration of 50km according to NPCR.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
