Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator IRP This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human
health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor radioactive
waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is
also not measured by this indicator.
