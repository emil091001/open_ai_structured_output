of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
We believe that timeless design is a solid environmental effort; enhanced further by the light environmental footprint we leave behind with each carefully
assembled piece of furniture. To ensure the quality of our products and the working conditions of our employees we manufacture our furniture ourselves or
by close friends. Scandia Junior is made in Norway.
The materials used are chosen with great consideration to the environmental impact of each component. All wood is FSC certified. Water based coating is
available upon specific request. Scandia Junior is tested in accordance with "Møbelfakta" quality requirements.
Our long-term goal is to lead the way towards becoming fully circular and sustainable. As of today- the Scandia Junior Chair is also possible to rent. Returned
chairs are, refurbished and made available for new customers.
Fjordfiesta is an Eco-lighthouse certified enterprise.
