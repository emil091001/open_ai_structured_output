Product
Product description:
The insulation board is provided in several dimensions and thicknesses. Please use the conversion table below for other sizes than the declared
unit.
Product description
Extruded polystyrene (XPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings and constructions. It's a polymer foam, consisting of air-
filled polystyrene cells. As most of the material is air, XPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics of the material
include low moisture absorption, long service life and high compressive strength.
This LCA is based on Jackofoam 250 and can be used for all Jackofoam products with the conversion factor which can be found under System
boundaries.
Product specification
XPS is manufactured through an extruder where polystyrene granulates are mixed with additives and foaming
agents to produce the foam mass. The foam mass is pressed out flat to a board through a nozzle in deisre thickness and cut into correct
dimensions. Some of the remaining blowing agents are aired out before the product leaves the factory gate.
The number of the product is the pressure class; here 250 which means a short dermation of 10% when the load of the product is 250 kN/m2.
Weight per declared unit is 0,971 kg given a density of 28,5 kg/cubic meter with a thickness of 34 mm including packaging material.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
3 / 12
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
