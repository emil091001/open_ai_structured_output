Market:
This EPD is intended for the Finnish market. The EPD can be used in other specific Nordics markets by adjusting the A4 module to reflect correct
transportation distance.
Reference service life, product
ROCKWOOL® stone wool thermal insulation products are extremely durable and provide effective performance for the lifetime of a building or
host structure, with no need to be replaced. The thermal, fire-resistance, and acoustic performance of ROCKWOOL® stone wool products, when
correctly installed, remains the same during 60 years reference service life or as long as the insulation is part of the building.
Reference service life, building or construction works
In this EPD, the reference service life of a building is set to 60 years.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy are included. All hazardous materials and substances are considered in the inventory. Data sets
within the system boundary are complete and fulfil criteria for the exclusion of inputs and output criteria. All data, materials and energy
consumptions, have been specified according to the production data and have been considered within the inventory analysis.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Production activities, electricity and energy consumption and waste
generation are allocated equally among all products from the production site through mass allocation.
Data quality:
All data represents the applicable geography, time and technology for the specific and generic data, generally assessed as good and very good.
Primary data are collected from the specific production sites, in the reference year 2021 and represent stabilized production. Generic data is from
GaBi database (version 2021) with GaBi Software version 10.0.1.92.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The EPD is based on LCA inventory data from the producing factories. The reference flow is a weighted average based on the distribution of
production capacity
Transport from production place to assembly/user (A4)
The A4 distance is calculated as weighted average distance for the Finnish market
Assembly (A5)
In A5 the default installation is assumed to be manual, therefore no energy consumption or ancillary equipment is needed. The product waste
from installation is assumed to be 2% and according to the modularity principle of EN 15804+A2 its impacts are fully allocated to A5, following
same EoL scenario as in C. The A5 module includes also the corresponding end-of-life considerations for packaging (10 % landfill). The credits from
heat and electricity recovery from incineration or material recycling from module A5 (90% recycling and energy recovery) are attributed to module
D.
Use stage (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7)
There are no consumables and no maintenance (B2), repair (B3), replacements (B4) or refurbishments (B5) required during the use of
ROCKWOOL® thermal insulation products in standard conditions. They do not use energy (B6) or water (B7) during their operational life. No LCA:
Scenarios and additional technical information EPD for the best environmental decision 8 significant emissions to the indoor environment occur in
module (B1). Therefore, modules B1-B7 are not relevant for this EPD and will not be displayed in the tables below.
Benefits and loads beyond the system boundaries (D)
Benefits in module D are created from packaging materials treatment after installation and recycling potential of stone wool in the end of life.
Quantities of packaging materials include both recycled materials and materials sent for energy recovery. Recycling potential of net stone wool
material is considered here.

Remarks to environmental impacts
The main GWP contribution from the product life cycle is linked to the Product stage (A1-A3). This is primarily related to the materials delivered to
the factory gate and consumption of
energy.
The CO2 absorbed by the wood in the wooden pallets is represented by a negative GWPbiogenic.
The GWP-Biogenic, e.g. the carbon stored in the wooden pallets, is released during the construction stage phase (A5) where the wood is
presumed incinerated with energy recovery.
The benefits from energy recovery (a negative GWP) from incineration of packaging materials (wood pallets and plastic foils) is allocated to
Benefits & Loads beyond system (D).
Impacts linked to end of life stages (C1-C4) are primarily linked to transportation of stone wool to recycling or to landfill.
Melting virgin materials or re-melting returned ROCKWOOL stone wool are both similarly energy intensive processes. Increasing the recycling rate
for return wool, will therefore not lead to great variations in the overall GWP profile. However, increased recycling will be linked directly to
reduction of waste sent to landfill.
