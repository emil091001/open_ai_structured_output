principle EN 15804 that would be assigned to the production system, which has caused the waste. In this EPD
the CO contribution is not subtracted. This is to ensure comparability across countries of calculated global

warming potentials for cements even if the used secondary fuels in other countries do not have waste status.
Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235.This impact category deals
mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizingradiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does
not consider effects due to possiblenuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor radioactive waste disposal in
undergroundfacilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, radon and some construction materials is also not
measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators: abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources, abiotic depletion potential for non-
fossil resources, water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption, potential
comparative toxic unit for ecosystems, potential comparative toxic unit for humans - cancer effects, potential
comparative toxic unit for humans – non-cancer effects, potential soil quality index.The results of this
environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as theuncertainties on these results are high or as there is
limited experience with the indicator.
