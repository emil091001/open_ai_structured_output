Product
Product description:
This is an average EPD representing same product produced in two production sites: weber Kiikala and Parainen premix plants. A1-A3 data is
based on weighted arithmetic mean of specific data of the production sites and production volumes of study year. Variation sites: -2% to 2% in
A1-A3 GWP-total, -9% to 8% in A1-A3 ODP. Variation specific products: -4% to 5% in A1-A3 GWP-total.
weber 414 Unirender is sprayed or manually spread rendering plaster for lightweight aggregate blocks, lightweight concrete and concrete blocks
and brick surfaces for large levelling and fillings, e.g. for levelling substrates for insulation, for filling window framework and for thick levelling for
interior repairs. The product is also used as a filling plaster in the UniTop three-layer plastering system as well as in the MonoRoc insulation
plastering system. The product is fibre reinforced and low water absorptive. It is very water vapor permeable so that moisture in the structure can
escape. Delivered in 25kg and 1000kg bags and loose in silos. GTIN 6415910021078 (25 kg), 6415990336291 (1000 kg), 6415990340878

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg weber 414 Unirender
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw materials extraction to product transportation to the building site, assembly as well as end of life stage and phases beyond
the system boundary (A1-A5, C1-C4, D) are included in the analysis.
The basic production process is similar in both production sites. It comprises of mixing raw materials together. Ready mixed product is then put
into bags or silos for delivery. A weighted arithemtic mean of the different packaging variants is applied in this analysis. At assembly phase, water is
added according to the instructions and it is mixed. Stage B is not considered. When building is de-constructed at the end-of-life, the structure
with plaster integrated into it are crushed. 90% of crushed material is recycled and used to replace natural gravel in soil construction, remaining
10% being disposed to landfill. System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below.
One or both specific products vary in A1-A3 results in relation to this average LCA results by over 10% in indicators: GWP-biogenic, ODP, EP-
Freshwater, ADP-fossil, PM, IRP, HTP-c, HTTP-nc, SQP, PERM, PERT, PENRE, PENRM, PENRT, FW, HWD, RWD, MFR, EEE, EET and Biogenic carbon
content in packaging. GWP-total and ODP variation is stated on page 3.
Additional technical information:
The LCA calculation has been made taking into account the fact that during the manufacturing process 100% renewable electricity is used. This
100% renewable electricity bought is evidenced by Guarantee of Origin certificates (GOs) from LOS, valid for the study year (2022) and after.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The results of stage A4 (transportation of product) in the table of this EPD refer to transportation in Finland (average distance 2022). This product
may also be delivered to the countries in the lower table "Transport from production place to user (A4)". In order to adapt the impact of
transportation to these countries, A4 figures from this EPD shall be multiplied by the multiplication factors below.
At installation stage, it is assumed that mixing is done by electric mixer. Electricity mix used is that of Finland. Material loss is considered to be 5%.
At end of life stage, it is assumed that all demolition waste is collected and 90% of crushed building material is recycled and 10% is disposed into
landfill. Transport distance to processing is estimated to be 30 km.
