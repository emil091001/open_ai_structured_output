Product
Product description:
Norgips Ultra Board ECO 13 is a gypsum board consisting of a fiberglass reinforced plaster core with high density. The front and back paper liners
are overlapped and glued together on the backside of the gypsum board. The long sides have tapered edges for easy treatment with compound,
the short sides are cut.
The product is particularly suitable for the cladding of internal walls, ceilings and partitions in all types of buildings. Norgips Ultra Board 13
provides the toughest and most robust wall construction with classified fire and sound requirements. Norgips Ultra Board ECO 13 makes it
possible to mount fixtures directly into the board without the need for plugs. Norgips Ultra Board ECO13 is a new generation of gypsum board
that is significantly stronger than a traditional gypsum board.
Norgips Ultra Board ECO13 is produced with 100 % renewable energy and liquefied bio gas (LBG).
Product specification
Norgips Ultra Board ECO13 is produced in various width and lengths, but in the same thickness and it is therefore no variations of the product
per square meter.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included when specific information are missing. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and
substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
The calcined gypsum is transferred to the mixer where water and additives are added. The slurry is distributed to a plasterboard liner where the
edges are folded and a new layer of plasterboard liner is glued on to form a sandwich. The board line is continuous transferred along the
production line, cut to suitable lengths and dried in a kiln. The dried boards are cut to the correct lengths and stacked in pallets.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
