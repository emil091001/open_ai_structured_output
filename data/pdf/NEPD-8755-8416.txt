Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

The analysis is a cradle-to-grave study made for 1 m of cable manufactured , installed and used indoors or outdoors over the lifetime 40 years.
Modules A1-A5 are included in the analysis. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the factory, the
production process itself, transportation to market and installation of the product. Modules B1-B7 describe the use phase and are declared for an
outdoor cable. B6 is the operational energy usage based on a normal use. C1-C4, D are mandatory modules which include end of life treatment of
materials and the benefits from recycling.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = We have calculated the weighted average of distances to customers.
Modules A5 = 2 % product losses during installation are estimated by the company. No energy use has been quantified since installation in
buildings is often done by manual labor. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off
criterion of 1%.
For B1-B5+B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are assumed to be zero. Some other potential environmental
impacts from the use phase might not be covered by the scope of an EPD.
Module B6 = The operational energy use of the cable is calculated based on the methodology described in PEP Ecopassport, Product Specific Rules
(PSR) for wires, cables
and accessories, reference PSR-0001-ed3-EN-2015 10 16. The following parameters are used to calculate the electricity loss of the cable:
- Estimate service life = 40 years
- Number of conductors = 2 units
- Use rate = 70 percent (according to appendix 1 of the PSR)
- Linear conductor resistivity = 0,00741 Ohm per meter
- Current intensity = 1 Ampere
Module C1 = For both buildings and construction work, cables will be taken out as part of a larger demolition. The energy use for cable removal
compared to other heavier materials is assumed to be low. This module can therefore be included with zero impact.
Module C2 = Estimated average of 85km (Scandinavian standard).
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consists of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life.
The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by
the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
