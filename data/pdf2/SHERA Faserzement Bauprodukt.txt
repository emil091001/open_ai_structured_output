2.6 Manufacture
Wastewater: Non-paint contaminated wastewater is
treated by designated treatment plant and 100 %
recycled back into the manufacturing process. Paint-
contaminated wastewater is properly treated by using
common and non-hazardous chemical agents to
separate the paint element out of wastewater.
Solid Waste: Non-contaminated wastes, which are C-
grade products and non-paint-contaminated sludge are
either reused or recycled. C-graded products have
been reused as a pallet for supporting SHERA’s
merchandise. Non-paint-contaminated sludge has
been used as an input for the production process. The
remained sludge from non-paint-contaminated
wastewater has been used for land application in the
factory. The paint-contaminated sludge is treated by
the external facility, as is the partnership to treat the
contaminated sludge in an appropriate way.
