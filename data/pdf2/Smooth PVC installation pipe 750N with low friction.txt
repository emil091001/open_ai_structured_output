LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A5 = 5 % product losses during installation are estimated by the company. No energy use has been quantified since installation in buildings is
often done by manual labour. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy requirements falling under the cut-off criterion
of 1%.
C1 = de-construction in buildings is often done by manual labour. Use of portable electrical devices (e.g., drill) usually have low energy
requirements falling under the cut-off criterion of 1%.
C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle assessments
of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will likely be treated
during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy recovery and fly
ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life. The
benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by the
incineration with energy recovery of plastics is also calculated in module D.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
