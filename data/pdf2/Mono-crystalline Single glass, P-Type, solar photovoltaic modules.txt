Product
Product description:
Mono-crystalline solar photovoltaic modules are designed to be installed on roofs or as stand-
alone systems for local power production. All the modules included in this EPD are single glass
and the solar cells are produced with PERC process. Solar cells are assembled with the EVA, glass,
frame and electrical connections to produce the finished solar module in the production factory
in Nanjing in China.
This EPD represents multiples modules with small variations over the size, the number of cells,
power‚Ä¶ (see table of module characteristics in ‚ÄúTechnical details‚Äù). The results are calculated
based on the maximum inventory amongst the modules. The variation between each module
results is lower than 10 %.
Product specification:
The packaging consists of LDPE, PP, paper and a cardboard box, and the panels are delivered on
a wooden pallet.

Declared unit:
1m¬≤ of manufactured photovoltaic module
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all essential energy is included. The production process for raw
materials and energy flows with very small amounts (<1%) are not included. This cut-off rule
does not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of ISO 14025. Incoming energy and
water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all products through mass
allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials allocated to the main product in
which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated
to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data comes from actual consumption of the module assembly factory (August 2021 ‚Äì July
2022). This data has been collected by the manufacturer and checked by the LCA practitioner.
Generic data is from Ecoinvent v3.6 and SimaPro v9. Characterization factors from
EN15804:2012 + A2: 2019. Generic data <10 years old.

Where:
- I is the sun irradiation received by the module in kWh. m-2.year-1, which depends on the
sun
site location (Norway : 1000 kWh. m-2.year-1, source : Global Solar Atlas)
- PR, or Performance Ratio, is the ratio between the energy produced by the panel and the
final energy at the output of the photovoltaic system to consider the various losses:
o The conservative PR, estimated by Global Solar Atlas, has been considered: 75%.
- Eff , or panel efficiency, is the ratio between the energy produced and the solar
panel
radiation received.
- b is the bifacial gain (5% if bifacial and 0% if monofacial)
- S is the surface area to get 1 kWp.

- D corresponds to the degradation of the panel in year i. For example, in this EPD, the
panel
degradation is 2% the first year and then 55% per year. D =0.98 √ó (1-0.55%)i-1.

EPD for the best environmental decision 9
1 This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel
cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal
in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not
measured by this indicator.
2 The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as
there is limited experienced with the indicator

Guarantees of origin from the use of electricity in the manufacturing phase
In the context of China, a market-based approach is not applicable due to the absence of a
Guarantee of Origin system. Therefore, a location-based approach is employed to assess the
environmental impact of electricity in this EPD. National production mix from import, medium
voltage (production of transmission lines, in addition to direct emissions and losses in grid) of
applied electricity for the manufacturing process (A3).
Additional environmental impact indicators required for construction products (Wp)
In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon contribution to climate impact, the
indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the
principle of instantanious oxidation. GWP-IOBC is also reffered to as GWP-GHG in context to
Swedish public procurement legislation.

Extrapolation rules
Power peak
The environmental impacts are given for a specific module power peak, Wp = 555Wp. For a
EPD1
different Wp (for example Wp = 460Wp), the impacts can be re-calculated by applying to
project
each impact the following ratio: Wp / Wp = 555 Wp / 460 Wp.

Indeed, the 555 Wp and 460 Wp modules have the same impact per module (Impact ).
