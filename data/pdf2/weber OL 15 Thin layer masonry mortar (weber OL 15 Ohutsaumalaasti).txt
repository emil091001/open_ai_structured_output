Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
All processes from raw materials extraction to product transportation to the building site, assembly, as well as end of life stage and phases beyond
the system boundary (A1-A5, C1-C4, D) are included in the analysis.​
The basic production process comprises of mixing raw materials together. Ready mixed product is then packed into small bags. At assembly phase,
water is added according to instructions and it is mixed. When building is de-constructed at the end-of-life, the structure with mortar integrated
into it are crushed. 90% of crushed material is recycled and used to replace natural gravel in soil construction, remaining 10% being disposed to
landfill.​
System boundaries (cradle-to-gate with options) are illustrated in the picture below.
Additional technical information:
The LCA calculation has been made taking into account the fact that during the manufacturing process 100% renewable electricity is used. This
100% renewable electricity bought is evidenced by Guarantee of Origin certificates (GOs) from LOS, valid for the study year (2021).​
Unused product powder is classified as hazardous waste. Product hardens after adding water in 5 to 6 hours and can then be disposed as mixed
construction waste.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The results of stage A4 (transportation of product) in the table of this EPD refer to transportation in Finland (average distance 2021). This product
may also be delivered to the countries in the table "Additional A4 information". In order to adapt the impact of transportation to these countries,
A4 figures from this EPD shall be multiplied by the multiplication factors below.​
At installation stage, it is assumed that mixing is done by electric mixer. Electricity mix used is that of Finland. Material loss is considered to be 0. ​
At end of life stage, it is assumed that all demolition waste is collected and 90% of crushed concrete is recycled and 10% is disposed into landfill.
Transport distance to processing is estimated to be 30 km.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
