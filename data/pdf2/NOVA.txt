Product
Product description:
NOVA grills are designed for air supply and air extract. The product is intended for installation in ducts, walls, or doors. The grille directs the air
using its adjustable blades, both horizontally and vertically.
Product specification
The NOVA grilles are available in various options and sizes.
Specific EPD data is provided as a reference for the NOVA-A-2-2-600×300-H-AN model.
Correction factors for other sizes can be estimated using the table in the Technical Data section below.

To estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWPtot) correction factor for specific product sizes, use the table below. For sizes not listed, calculate
the correction factor using the equations provided.
Each NOVA type has a specific equation. The correction factor is calculated by multiplying a coefficient by the area "A" (in m²), derived from the
product's nominal dimensions and adding a constant.
The equation for each type is as follows:
NOVA-A factor = 5,1386 * A + 0,0654
NOVA-C factor = 2,4804 * A - 0,0451
NOVA-D factor = 6,4212 * A + 0,0243
NOVA-E factor = 0,9020 * A + 0,1271
NOVA-EF factor = 0,6346 * A + 0,0558
NOVA-H factor = 0,8226 * A + 0,2253
NOVA-L factor = 5,2805 * A + 0,0456
NOVA-R factor = 3,6788 * A + 0,1582
The coefficients and constants in each equation are specific to each product type and adjust for GWPtot differences between models. These
equations enable you to estimate GWPtot correction factor for product sizes not listed in the table. By calculating "A" for desired product size and
applying the appropriate type of equation, you can determine the GWPtot correction factor.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Energy, water and waste production in-house is allocated equally among all
products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which the material was
used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
