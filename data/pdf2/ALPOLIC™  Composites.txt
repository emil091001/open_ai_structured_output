2. Product
2.1 Product description
ALPOLICTM Composites are thin panels consisting of two thin aluminium plates on both sides and a
thermoplastic or mineral-filled, fire-retardant core. The already painted aluminium surfaces are pro-
vided with an adhesive film and subsequently laminated with the core material.
ALPOLICTM products offer a huge range of surface types, colours and gloss levels for buildings. They are
coated with robust and stable polymer paint to keep surfaces fresh after decades of exposure to the
elements. At the same time, ALPOLICTM composites offer the rigidity of heavy sheet metal in a light-
weight composite material.
2.2 Application
ALPOLICTM composites are ideal for architectural projects, they can be easily processed into complex
shapes and are easy to install. At the same time, they offer excellent flatness, durability, stability, vi-
bration damping and ease of maintenance. This makes them suitable for curtain walls, rainscreen sys-
tems and other architectural cladding applications.
ALPOLICTM can be machined with standard woodworking or metalworking tools without the need for
special tools. Cutting, grooving, punching, drilling, bending, rolling and many other manufacturing
techniques can be easily performed to create an almost unlimited variety of complex shapes and
forms.

2.4 Placing on the market
ALPOLICTM Aluminium composite materials are used in accordance with the general building authority
approval.
2.5 Raw materials
The ALPOLICTM composites consist of thin aluminium coils on both sides and a thermoplastic or min-
eral-filled, fire-retardant core. The already painted aluminium surfaces are provided with an adhesive
film and then laminated with the core material.
Raw materials Unit Value
Aluminium coils M.-% 39
Core material M.-% 60
PE-based protective and adhesive film M.-% 1
There is no biogenic carbon in the products.
The product does not contain any substances from the "Candidate List of Substances of Very High
Concern for Authorisation" (SVHC).
2.6 Manufacturing
ALPOLICTM Aluminium Composites (ACM) are manufactured in Wiesbaden, Germany. The product is
manufactured by continuously bonding two aluminium coils on either side of an extruded thermo-
plastic or mineral-filled fire-retardant thermoplastic core. The aluminium surfaces have been pre-fin-
ished and coil-coated in various paint finishes before bonding.
2.7 Packing
ALPOLICTM Aluminium composite materials (ACM) are palletised.
2.8 Reference Service Life (RSL for short)
Since the scope of the study does not consider the entire life cycle of the composite, the specification
of the reference service life is voluntary. According to /BBSR Table 2017 / No. 335.811, metal cladding
made of painted aluminium achieves the reference service life of over 50 years.

3. LCA: Calculation rules
3.1 Declared unit
In accordance with the PCR Part B: Environmental Product Declaration Requirements for Aluminium
and Aluminium Alloy Composites, 1 m2 ALPOLICTM is chosen as the declared unit.
Since an average product with a specific weight per unit area of 7.6 to 8.6 kg/m2 is considered,
weighted weight per unit area is considered.
Product Unit Value
Declared unit 1 m2
Basis weight 7.8 kg/m2

3.2 System boundary
Illustration 1: System boundaries
The environmental product declaration is a cradle-to-gate EPD with consideration of additional life
phases, i.e. all potential environmental impacts of the product from the cradle to the factory gate and
the disposal phases waste treatment and landfill are considered. According to DIN EN 15804, this cor-
responds to the product phases A1-A3 as well as C3-4 and D.
The system boundaries include the following inputs and outputs:

3.3 Estimates and assumptions
Some of the aluminium consumed has a secondary content of 50 - 60% or > 50%. 50% was assumed in
each case, which corresponds to a worst-case scenario. In the case of PE-based adhesive and protective
films, rubber and resin components are partly specified in the product data sheets. For simplification
and due to the low overall relevance to the result, it was assumed that the films consist exclusively of
PE. For the disposal of the composites, it is assumed that the aluminium portion is recycled. Thermal
recycling was assumed for the plastic portion of the core material, and landfilling was assumed for the
remainder.
3.4 Cut-off criteria
For the process modules A1 to A3, all process-specific data were collected. All flows could be assigned
potential environmental impacts through the database.
3.5 Reference period and geographical reference area
The production data have been recorded for the operating year 2021. The geographical reference area
is Germany (Wiesbaden).
3.6 Data quality
The data quality of the life cycle inventory is assessed based on its precision (measured, calculated,
literature values or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions), consistency (degree of uni-
formity of the methods used) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, technological).
To address these aspects and thus ensure reliable results, first-hand industry data were used together
with consistent background data from the GaBi Sphera databases (version 2022.1) and the integrated
Ecoinvent v3.8 database.
3.7 Allocation
Allocations were avoided.
3.8 Comparability
In principle, a comparison or evaluation of EPD data is only possible if all data sets to be compared
were created according to EN 15804 and the building context or the product-specific performance
characteristics are taken into account.
The background database used is GaBi 10 ts from Sphera, database version 2022.1 and the inte-
grated Ecoinvent v3.8.

5. LCA: Results
The following tables show the results of the impact assessment indicators, resource consumption,
waste and other production flows. The results presented here refer to the declared average product.
Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IR: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing radi-
ation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.

6. LCA: Interpretation
6.1 Dominance analysis
The impact categories are dominated by the provision of raw materials, especially aluminium (see Fig-
ure 2).
Figure 2 Dominance analysis of the modules
In the GWP, 81% of the climate-relevant emissions are caused by the provision of aluminium, approx.
3% each are due to transport and production. Wood pallet represents the largest part of the A3 bio-
genic CO2 input (minus value). However, this has a minimal impact on the total effect in the "Climate
Change" (see "Climate Change - total"). Waste treatment (thermal utilisation of plastics and landfilling
of the mineral part) also has a relevant influence in the impact category climate change and a minimal
contribution of approx. 2-3% to acidification, eutrophication and photochemical ozone formation. The
raw materials (A1) have a much stronger influence on the following impact categories, each with over
80%:
• Climate Change - total [kg CO2 eq.]
• Ozone depletion [kg CFC-11 eq.]
Page | 12 Mitsubishi Polyester Film GmbH - ALPOLICTM Composites
• Eutrophication , freshwater [kg P eq.]
• Resource use, mineral and metals [kg Sb eq.]
• Resource use, fossils [MJ]
• Water use [m³ world equiv.]
In the case of acidification, a good 20% is caused by transport, while in the case of eutrophication (all
subcategories) the figure is as high as 29%. Packaging and production (A3) have an insignificant influ-
ence on the results in all categories (<5%).
Module "D" can achieve a saving of the total impact between 1 and 50% (eutrophication, climate
change), if applicable.
6.2 Data quality
Overall, the data quality can be classified as good. All relevant process-specific data could be collected
in the farm data collection. Consistent data records from the Gabi database were available for almost
all inputs and outputs (GaBi 2022.2 + Ecoinvent 3.8). The background data fulfil the requirements of
EN 15804+A2. The production data have been recorded for the operating year 2021. The quantities of
raw materials, consumables and supplies used as well as the energy consumption have been recorded
for the entire operating year. The life cycle assessment was carried out for all listed product items. A
good representativeness of the data for the declared average product can be assumed (see Table 1;
grade 1 - excellent quality, grade>4 insufficient quality).
