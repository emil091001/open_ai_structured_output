Declaration number Declared product / declared unit
EPD-CLO-20240119-CBA1-EN The declared product is the two-component reaction resin mortar "ResiFIX
Pure Epoxy EPSF", manufactured by CELO Befestigungssysteme GmbH.
The declared unit is based on 1 kg reaction resin product in the ratio at
which the two components must be mixed before use. The packaging is
also included in the calculation, since the product is sold by CELO
Befestigungssysteme GmbH with its packaging. The declared unit is
indicated in [kg].
This declaration is based on the product category rules: Scope:
Reaction resin products, 01.08.2021 This document covers the two-component reaction resin mortar "ResiFIX
(PCR checked and approved by the SVR) Pure Epoxy EPSF". To prepare the life cycle assessment [LCA], specific
data were collected from the CELO Befestigungssysteme GmbH
manufacturing facility in CELO Befestigungssysteme GmbH, Plant2
Issue date Germany. The assessment is based on data from 2020 which correspond
to the yearly average.
