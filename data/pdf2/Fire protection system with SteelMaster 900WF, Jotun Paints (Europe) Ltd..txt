Product
Product description:
SteelMaster 900WF is a one component waterborne acrylic thin film intumescent coating. It is independently approved for fire protection of
structural steel exposed to cellulosic fire. It can be used as mid coat or finish coat in atmospheric environments.
It is suitable on approved primers on carbon steel substrates.
The declared product is specially designed as a reactive fire protection system for steel constructions. It is designed to protect for up to 120
minutes on a wide range of I section beams, columns and hollows. It has been fire tested and approved to BS 476 part 20/21. It is suitable for
structural steel exposed to internal environments.
SteelMaster 900WF requires one layer of a Primer e.g. Penguard Express - UK and one layer of Topcoat e.g. Hardtop XP - UK. An EPD for each
product is published in www.epd-norge.no
For a detailed coating specification please contact your local Jotun representative.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
This is an operational cradle to gate (A1-A3) study with options, in additional module A4 transport to market, A5 application, B2 maintenance,
modules C1 to C4 and module D have been included, as described below. The declared unit (DU) refers to the total amount of SteelMaster 900WF,
Penguard Express and Hardtop XP required to protect 1 m2 of structural steel for its entire lifespan.
Modules A1-A3 background information is based on CEPE and EcoInvent databases. Where A1 accounts for each raw material in the formulation
per 1 kg of product including the packaging. A2 accounts for the transport of raw materials, distance and type(s) of transport and are collected
from the manufacturing facility. A3 accounts for production data, the energy consumption and waste management are based on collection of data
from the manufacturing site.
Module A4 includes the transport of 1 kg of the declared product with packaging from place of production to the market where the product is
sold. The calculation is based on average distances to distribution centers in the local market. The declared product is assumed to be transported
with the common type of truck used locally.
Module A5 is based on Application Guide and Technical Data Sheet for SteelMaster 900WF. A5 includes surface preparation, paint application,
transport, waste treatment and direct emissions.
Prior to application, the surface will be cleaned with high pressure water jetting. It will then be pretreated with abrasive blasting to achieve the
required roughness. Electricity, water, and sand blasting are considered as inflows.
Products application: The following parameters were used to estimate the amount of each coating, the sum of them correspond to the DU.
SteelMaster 900WF: 2 layer; spreading rate = 0,97 m2/L; quantity = 2.9 kg/m2
Primer - Penguard Express: 1 layer; spreading rate = 7,98 m2/L; quantity = 0.2 kg/m2
Topcoat - Hardtop XP: 1 layer, spreading rate = 12,67 m2/L; quantity = 0.1 kg/m2
Declared unit: 3.2 kg/m2
Product application is modelled with extra 20% due to losses in a semi-covered area. It includes paints with their respective packaging, and
transport.
The paint application is performed using Airless Spray for all three coatings. To estimate the amount of energy required by these spray guns,
Graco Inc. insight and devices were used as reference. This does not limit the use of other tools/brands during the paint application phase.
The electricity mix used is from the United Kingdom, see Table Electricity Mix in Chapter Additional requirements. The Assembly A5 table shows
the total amount of electricity consumed by different devices: water jetting, blasting process, and airless spray paint devices.
Waste generated in phase A5 is treated differently and there is a lack of data regarding its treatment. For this analysis we have assumed that
100% of paint waste (assumed as "dried paint residues" representing all 3 products), packaging waste (divided into 5 materials) and blasting media
(assumed to be inert material) are sent to landfill. Transport to landfill is also considered and VOC emissions are modelled directly to air.
Module B2 maintenance is assumed to be "zero" as the paint system is designed to be maintenance-free for the whole lifetime of the object.
Module C considers the end-of-life of the construction material. The calculations for module C are based on dried/cured paint. Solvents and water
are subtracted from the total coating mass due to the drying/curing processes occurring in modules A5 and B2. Similarly, packaging waste is
generated in module A5 and B2, thus it is not accounted for in module C.
Module C1 is modelled with zero impact for the declared product. The coating is not removed from the substrate during decommissioning
process, therefore the impact is allocated to the coated object.
Module C2 includes the transport of the paint waste to the closest disposal or waste treatment facility. It is assumed that the waste is transported
by truck with average characteristics listed in Table C2.
Module C3 is modelled with no waste paint processing.
Module C4, paint waste is gathered as part of the substrate in construction materials. A typical disposal scenario for paint applied on that
substrate is landfill, therefore it is assumed that 100% of the paint waste is sent to landfill facilities.
Module D. Recycling of applied paint is not a common practice, therefore the reuse, recovery and recycling potential is set to zero.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
