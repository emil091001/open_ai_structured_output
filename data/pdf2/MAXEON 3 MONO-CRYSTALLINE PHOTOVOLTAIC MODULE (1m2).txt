Mexico, where they are assembled with the
backsheet, frame and electrical connections
to produce the finished solar module.

Operational energy (B6) and water consumption (B7)
The panels produce electricity during their lifetime but require no inputs/outputs.
To calculate the expected energy production over the lifetime of the panels, the following formula may be used:

End of Life (C1, C3, C4)
The end of life scenario taken into account is that of the program
PVCYCLE, to which SunPower subscribe. Panels are sent for
processing and separated into their component parts for recycling
or elimination.
