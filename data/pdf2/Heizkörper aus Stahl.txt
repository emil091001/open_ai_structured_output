Declaration number Declared product / declared unit
EPD-VAS-20230254-CCB1-EN The environmental product declaration refers to the declared unit of 1 kg
steel radiator.
This declaration is based on the product category rules: Scope:
Radiators, 24.07.2023 This document relates to the manufacture, transport, installation, operation
(PCR checked and approved by the SVR) and disposal of steel radiators. The products are produced in Germany
and the Czech Republic. The production data was collected at the
Pankofen plant and Stříbro in 2021.
Issue date
This EPD applies to the following product groups:
29.08.2023
• Steel panel radiators/plate radiators
• Heating walls/flat tube radiators
Valid to
28.08.2028 • Convectors/flat tube radiators
• Design radiators/round tube radiators
The owner of the declaration shall be liable for the underlying information
and evidence; the IBU shall not be liable with respect to manufacturer
information, life cycle assessment data and evidences.
The EPD was created according to the specifications of EN 15804+A2. In
the following, the standard will be simplified as EN 15804.

Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator “Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235”. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low-dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the
soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators “abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources”, “abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources”,
“water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption”, “potential comparative toxic unit for ecosystems”,
“potential comparative toxic unit for humans – cancerogenic”, “Potential comparative toxic unit for humans - not cancerogenic”,
“potential soil quality index”. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these
results are high as there is limited experience with the indicator.
