Product description
Product description and description of use:
This EPD describes the potential environmental impacts of 1 m² of glass wool insulation, ISOVER
Granulat, with a thermal resistance equal to 1,00 m2K/W
The intended use of this EPD is to communicate scientifically based environmental information for
construction products, for the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of buildings.
ISOVER glass wool products are CE-labelled according to EN 13162 (2012) “Thermal Insulation
Products for Buildings. Factory made mineral wool (MW) Products. Specification”, and EN 13172
(2011) “Thermal Insulation Products – Evaluation of Conformity”
The production site of Saint-Gobain Denmark A/S, ISOVER in Vamdrup, Denmark, uses a small
amount of natural and abundant raw materials (sand, soda, limestone, feldspar) and a high share of
recycled glass cullets (more than 50 % of external glass cullets). This material is converted by using
fusion and fiberizing techniques to produce glass wool. The products obtained come in the form of
"mineral wool slabs, rolls, lamellas or as blowing wool" consisting of a soft, airy structure.
On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 10 °C: its thermal conductivity factor,
expressed in λ, is 0,025 W/(mK) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral
wool is close to immobile air as its lambda varies from 0,030 W/(mK) for the most efficient, to 0,042 W/
(mK) to the least efficient.
With its entangled structure, glass wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best
insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs airborne noise, impact
noise and offers acoustic correction inside premises.
Glass wool containing incombustible materials does not react to fire.
Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of
comfort and minimizes carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by preventing heat loss through roofs, walls,
2
floors, pipes and boilers. It reduces noise and protects homes and industrial facilities against fire.
Correctly installed glass wool products and solutions do not require maintenance, and last throughout
the lifetime of the building (which is set at 60 years as a default value in the model), or as long as the
insulated building component is a part of the building.

P roduct stage, A1- A3
Description of the stage:
The product stage of the mineral wool products is subdivided into 3 modules A1, A2 and A3
respectively “Raw material supply”, “transport” and “manufacturing”.
The aggregation of the modules A1, A2 and A3 is a possibility considered by the EN
15804:2012+2013:A1 standard. This rule is applied in this EPD.
A1, Raw material supply
This module takes into account the extraction and processing of all raw materials and energy which
occur upstream to the studied manufacturing process.
Specifically, the raw material supply covers production of binder components and sourcing (quarry) of
raw materials for fiber production, e.g. sand and borax for glass wool. Besides these raw materials,
glass cullet is also used as input.
About cullet: The main raw material for the production of glass insulation material is cullets or/and
sand. Only specific cleaning activities and transport is included for the cullets – and thus not the
impacts from the full life cycle of glass. The reason is that cullets are considered a waste product and
not initially produced for the purpose of glass wool insulation production.
The only activities included are:
- Magnetic separation of metallic piece
- Separation of other piece-crushing of glass (<20 mm)
- Separation of bottle cap crushing (<2 mm) sieving
- Transport
A2, Transport to the manufacturer
The raw materials are transported to the manufacturing site. In our case, the modeling includes: road
and boat transportations (specific values) of each raw material.
A3, Manufacturing
This module covers glass wool fabrication, including melting and fiberizing (see process flow diagram).
In addition, the production of packaging material is taking into account at this stage.

C onstruction process stage, A4- A5
Description of the stage:
The construction process is divided into 2 modules: A4, transport to the building site and A5,
installation in the building.
Description of scenarios and additional technical information:
A4, Transport to the building site:
This module includes transport from the production gate to the building site.
Transport is calculated on the basis of a scenario with the parameters described in the following table.

NEPD-3257-1898-EN ISOVER Granulat
A5, Installation into the building:
This module includes:
- Wastage of products: 2 %. These losses are landfilled (landfill model for glass, see
chapter End-of-life)
- Additional production processes to compensate for the loss
- Processing of packaging wastes: they are 100 % collected and modeled as recovered
matter.
- Energy used by blowing machine for installation.
PARAMETER VALUE
Wastage of materials on the building site before
waste processing, generated by the product’s 2 %
installation (specified by type)
Output materials (specified by type) as results of Packaging wastes are 100 % collected and modeled
waste processing at the building site e.g. of as recovered matter
collection for recycling, for energy recovering,
disposal (specified by route) Glass wool losses are landfilled
Energy used for installation 0,0432 MJ of diesel / kg of blowing wool
Use stage (excluding potential savings), B1- B7
Description of the stage:
The use stage is divided into the following modules:
- B1: Use
- B2: Maintenance
- B3: Repair
- B4: Replacement
- B5: Refurbishment
- B6: Operational energy use
- B7: Operational water use
Description of scenarios and additional technical information:
Once installation is complete, no actions or technical operations are required during the use stages
until the end-of-life stage. Therefore, glass wool insulation products have no impact (excluding
potential energy savings) on this stage.
7
NEPD-3257-1898-EN ISOVER Granulat
End-of-life stage, C1- C4
Description of the stage:
The stage includes the following different modules of end-of-life:
C1, De-construction, demolition
The de-construction and/or dismantling of insulation products are part of the demolition of the entire
building, and are assumed to be made manually. In our case, the environmental impact is assumed to
be very small and can be neglected.
C2, Transport to waste processing
Transport is included and calculated on the basis of a scenario with the parameters described in the
End-of-life table below.
C3, Waste processing for reuse, recovery and/or recycling
Today the product is considered to be landfilled without reuse, recovery or recycling.
C4, Disposal
The glass wool is assumed to be 100% landfilled.
Description of scenarios and additional technical information: See below
PARAMETER DESCRIPTION
The entire insulation product (wool) is collected with
Collection process specified by type
mixed construction waste
Recovery system specified by type No re-use, recycling or energy recovery
Disposal specified by type The entire insulation product (wool) is landfilled
Average truck trailer with a 24t payload, diesel
Assumptions for scenario development (e.g. consumption 38 liters for 100 km.
transportation) 25 km (default distance from the building site to
landfill).
Reuse/recovery/recycling potential, D
Description of the stage: For module D we only take into consideration the materials used for the
product, and not e.g. packaging. The environmental impact of recycling is therefore set to 0.

NEPD-3257-1898-EN ISOVER Granulat
LCA results
LCA model, aggregation of data and potential environmental impact are calculated from the GaBi
software 8.7 and CML impact method has been used, together with Thinkstep 8.7 (2018) and
ecoinvent V3.1 (2014) databases to obtain the inventory of generic data.
Following the “Default international characterization method” specified in ISO21930:2017, biogenic
carbon is not reported in the context of GWP-GHG.
Raw materials and energy consumption, as well as transport distances, have been taken directly from
the manufacturing plant of Saint-Gobain Denmark A/S, ISOVER in Vamdrup (Production data
according 2018).
Resume of the LCA results detailed on the following tables.
Cut-off criteria
The cut-off criterion used in Saint-Gobain EPD will be the mass criterion with the following details:
- Taking into account all input and output flows in a unit process i.e. taking into account the
value of all flows in the unit process and the corresponding LCI whenever available
- No simplification of the LCI by additional exclusions of material flows
Data collected at the manufacturing site was used. The inventory process in this LCA includes all data
related to raw material, packaging material and consumable items, and the associated transport to the
manufacturing site. Process energy and water use, direct production waste and emissions to air and
water are included. Scenarios have been developed to account for downstream processes such as
demolition and waste treatment in accordance with the requirements of EN 15804:2012+A1:2013
All inputs and outputs to the manufacturing plants have been included and made transparent. All
assumptions regarding the materials and water balances have also been included.
All hazardous and toxic materials and substances are considered in the inventory even though they
are below the cut off criteria.
There are excluded processes in the inventory:
- Flows related to human activities, such as employee transport and administration activity, are
according to the PCR not accounted for.
Allocation
Allocation criteria are based on mass.
The allocation of all the air emissions, wastes and energy usage are based on mass (kg). The reason
we can use a mass basis is because we use the exact same manufacturing process shown for every
product. We only produce glass mineral wool at the Vamdrup site using the same process and
therefore all the factors can be allocated by a mass basis.
The amount of binder varies for different products, and is accounted for.
A mass balance was conducted for the 2018 production year to ensure that we haven’t excluded any
materials, emissions and hence potential environmental impacts. Regarding the mass balance, all the
raw materials and corresponding production goods and wastes generated were taken into account.

Influence of particular thicknesses
The results in the tables of this EPD refer to ISOVER Granulat with a thickness of 42 mm for a
functional unit of 1 m² with a thermal resistance equals to 1,00 m2K/W
This EPD includes a range of thicknesses between 100 mm and 500 mm.
For every thickness, use a multiplication factor in order to obtain the environmental performance of
every thickness. Using the thickness factor will for some indicators give higher values than calculated
for the specific thickness in GaBi.
In order to calculate the multiplication factors, a reference unit has been selected (value of R= 1,00
m2K/W for 42 mm). Multiplication factors are obtained by making the LCA calculations for all
thicknesses, including packaging.
In order to obtain the environmental performance associated with the specific product and thickness,
the results expressed in this EPD must be multiplied by its corresponding multiplication factor.

[1] This indicator corresponds to the abiotic depletion potential of fossil resources.
[2] This indicator corresponds to the total use of primary energy.
[3] This indicator corresponds to the use of net fresh water.
[4] This indicator corresponds to the sum of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive waste disposed.
Global Warming Potential (Climate Change) (GWP)
When analyzing the above figure for GWP, it can clearly be seen that the majority of contribution to this environmental impact
is from the production modules (A1 – A3). This is primarily because the sources of greenhouse gas emissions are predominant
in this part of the life cycle. CO is generated upstream from the production of electricity and is also released on site by the
2
combustion of natural gas. We can see that other sections of the life cycle also contribute to the GWP; however, the production
modules contribute to over 80% of the contribution. Combustion of fuel in transport vehicles will generate the second highest
percentage of greenhouse gas emissions together the waste during the installation stage.
Non-renewable resources consumptions
We can see that the consumption of non-renewable resources is once more found to have the highest value in the production
modules. This is because a large quantity of natural gas is consumed within the factory, and non-renewable fuels such as
natural gas and coal are used to generate the large amount of electricity we use. The contribution to this impact from the
other modules is very small and primarily due to the non – renewable resources consumed during transportation.
Energy Consumptions
As we can see, modules A1 – A3 have the highest contribution to total energy consumption. Energy in the form of electricity
and natural gas is consumed in a vast quantity during the manufacture of glass mineral wool so we would expect the
production modules to contribute the most to this impact category.
Water Consumption
As we don’t use water in any of the other modules (A4 – A5, B1 – B7, C1 – C4), we can see that there is no contribution to
water consumption. For the production phase, water is used within the manufacturing facility and therefore we see the highest
contribution here. However, we recycle a lot of the water on site so the contribution is still relatively low.
Waste Production
Waste production does not follow the same trend as the above environmental impacts. The largest contributor is the end of
life module. This is because the entire product is sent to landfill once it reaches the end of life state. However, there is still an
impact associated with the production module since we do generate waste on site. The following small impact associated with
installation is due to the loss rate of product during implementation.
