Product description:
Product variation and calculation of averages
The insulation board is provided in several dimensions and thicknesses. Please use the conversion table below for other sizes than the declared
unit.
Product description
Thermodren is a board which is for insulation and drainage outside on the cellar wall. The horisontal and vertical holes in the board makes sure
that the water from the outside get into the holes and down into the drainage pipes. The holes also make sure that the cellar wall keeps dry. The
board can also be delivered with a non voven textile to prevent small particles to clog up the holes.
Thermodren can also be used for on blue/green roofs and terrace.
Product specification
Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings, including floors, walls and ceilings. It is a polymer foam,
consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells.
EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of
a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w.
The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The
amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 70 provides a density at 70 kN/m2, which is
approximately 17,5 kg/m3. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out.
Weight per declared unit is 0,70 kg given a density of 17,5 kg/cubic meter with a thickness of 40 mm.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.

1. The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the
indicator
2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
