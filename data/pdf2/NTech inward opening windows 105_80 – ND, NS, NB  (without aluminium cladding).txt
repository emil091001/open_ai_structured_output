LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD
An average distance of 300 km with truck is used within Norway. The transportation from production to construction site is based on a
scenario where the product is transported on a large lorry to a radius of 250 km to a warehouse. Transport from warehouse to a
construction site is assumed to be 50 km on a medium truck.

Global warming potential in A1-A3 includes sequestration of CO2 as carbon in the wood. The same amount is accounted as an
emission in module C3. Additionally, it is included sequestration in the wood packaging. This is accounted as an emission in module

Indoor air quality
The product has not been tested for emissions to indoor environments.
Carbon footprint
To increase the transparency of the climate impacts, the GWP indicator has been divided into sub-indicators:
GWP-IOBC Climate impacts calculated according to instant oxidation principle
GWP-BCIP Climate impacts calculated from the net impacts of sequestration and emission of biogenic carbon
Climate impact without alu clad

Additional information
For the products with different sizes from the declared unit, the environmental impacts must be converted by using a conversion
factor. The Norwegian EPD Foundation has published instructions on how to interpret EPDs for windows on its website (www.epd-
norge.no) where different calculation methods have been stated. (Document: Bruksanvisninger i hvordan tolke EPD'er – Vinduer)
