2.10 Packaging
The powder coating under review is packed either in
cardboard boxes lined with PE bags or big bags. The
used materials for packaging are recyclable or
thermally utilized. The various containers are
transported on wooden pallets which can be re-used.
2.11 Condition of use
TIGER Drylac® Series 75 is typically used as coating
on aluminium for facades and window frames in a
cured state. The coating represents an irreversible
thermosetting cross-linking of polymer chains which
are insoluble in water and therefore have a constant
composition during use.
