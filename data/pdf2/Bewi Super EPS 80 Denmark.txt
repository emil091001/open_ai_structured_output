Product description:
Product variation and calculation of averages:
- The insulation board is provided in several dimensions and thicknesses. Please use the conversion table in this EPD for other sizes and densities
than the declared variant.
Product description:
- BEWI Super EPS are boards made from expanded polystyrene (EPS). Graphite is added to the raw material, which gives it the grey color and at
the same time reduces radiant heat loss, thereby decreasing thermal conductivity by approximately 20% (compared to traditional white EPS,
Jackopor Flamingo). Then it's possible to meet the same energy requirements with 20% less volume, lower CO2 footprint, and less material usage.
- Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings, including floors, walls and roofs. It is a polymer foam,
consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells. As 98% of the material is air, EPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics
of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life, high compressive strength and 100% recyclable.
- EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition
of a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w. In BEWI Super EPS, graphite is added in small amounts to further improve thermal insulation
properties. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS.
The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the density of the block, where pressure class 80 (JS80) provides a compressive stress at 80
kN/m², which is approximately 16,3 kg/m³. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out and the blocks are cut into the
desired shape.
- Weight per declared unit is 0,51 kg given a density of 16,3 kg/m³ with a thickness of 31 mm.

Reference service life, product
The reference service life of EPS products varies depending on where in the building the products are used. In Denmark, the service life tables
from BUILD are used to determine the reference service life of EPS in various building contexts (according to BR18 § 297 Stk. 7).

Reference service life, building or construction works
The reference service life of a building varies depending on the building type. In Denmark, the service life tables from BUILD are used to determine

Cut-off criteria:
3 / 12
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804+A2. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Product & Construction installation stages (A1-A5)
- The product stage includes the acquisition of all raw materials, products and energy, transport to the production site, packaging, and waste
processing up to the ‘‘end-of-waste” state or final disposal.
- No solid waste is generated from the production of EPS products, as the waste is immediately returned to production line (however, some solid
waste is produced from the raw material packaging, e.g., cardboard).
- The pentane content in the EPS products is highest right after production, after which it continues to decrease. After approximately one month
almost all the pentane has been emitted from the products. The release of pentane is reported in module A3 since it relates to the production.
- A2-A4 is based on a weighted average for BEWI Denmark's Danish production sites (BEWI Hedensted and Maribo).
- For A4, a weighted average distance is calculated based on the distance from BEWI Hedensted to three outer areas: Skagen, Padborg and
Nyborg, and from BEWI Maribo to Copenhagen, Kalundborg and Odense. The weighted average distance is 170 km.
End of Life stage (C1-C4) includes:
- The EPS product is dismantled manually, thus, no environmental impacts are associated with module C1. The dismantled EPS product is
transported 20 km to an incineration plant by a EURO 6 diesel truck.
- Incineration of the dismantled EPS is included in module C3. Energy credits related to energy recovery from the incineration is included in
module D.
Re-use, recovery, and recycling potential (D) includes:
- Credits for energy recovery related to the incineration is included in module D.
- The packaging materials, LDPE foil and EPS pallets, reach the end-of-waste stage in module A5, and the benefits from recycling and incineration
of the packaging materials are included in module D.

Dangerous substances
The product contains no substances given by the REACH Candidate list.
Indoor environment
The EPD does not give information on release of dangerous substances to indoor air because the horizontal standards on the relevant
measurements are not available. Read more in EN15804+A1 chapter 7.4.1.
The EPD does not give information on release of dangerous substances to soil and water because the horizontal standards on the relevant
measurements are not available. Read more in EN15804+A1 chapter 7.4.2.
Additional Environmental Information
Additional environmental impact indicators required in NPCR Part A for construction products
Indicator Unit A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 C1 C2 C3 C4 D

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
