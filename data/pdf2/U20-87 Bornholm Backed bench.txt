Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Energy flows and materials representing less than 1% of the total are excluded. Cut-off does not apply for REACH materials.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. Allocation as per EN 15804.
Impacts from primary production of virgin material are assigned to respective component production and includes transportation.
Impacts from repair and replacement are not included in the use stage, as the materials used in the product are designed to last longer than the
stated lifespan
Impacts from primary production of recycled materials are assigned to respective component production, and includes recycling and
transportation processes.
Emissions from disposal of the product are included and allocated per material. Energy recovery from incineration of relevant materials is included
and allocated on a national level.
Data quality:
3 / 12
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​
Data has been gathered from sub suppliers and public, current, published EPDs or ecoinvent 3.6 database.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Production scenario assumes production in Sweden at sub-suppliers with transport of materials and components between certain production
steps.
Usage scenario assumes no repair or replacement and minimal maintenance during the 15 year lifespan of the product, as materials and surface
treatments are selected to require servicing during lifetime of product. The installation location is assumed to be within Sweden.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
