Product
Product description:
AluWood is a solution for facade cladding, designed specifically for outdoor applications. It combines thermally modified Nordic Spruce (Picea)
certified as PCAB EU (N) Termo D by the International ThermoWood Association, with an coated aluminum plate for enhanced durability and
weather resistance.
The system is installed on wooden battens with a wind barrier, supporting only vertical mounting for optimal performance and aesthetic appeal.
AluWood is available with or without paint. This EPD represents the "worst case" scenario, which includes the coating (paint), resulting in higher
emissions. Excluding the emissions from the coating reflects AluWood without paint.
Product specification
This declaration, including data collection and the modelled foreground system including results, represents the production of 1 m2 of AluWood
product at the production site located in Skaerbaek, Denmark.
Product specific data are based on average values collected in 2024. Background data are based on Ecoinvent 3.6 and are less than 10 years old.
Generally, the used background datasets are of high quality, and the majority of the datasets are only a couple of years old. Additionally, the
background data for wood and glue are derived from two EPDs. For wood, the source is Lunawood Thermowood of Nordic Pine and Spruce, while
for glue, it is Products based on polyurethane or silane-modified polymer, group 1, with declaration number EPD-FEI-20220021-IBG1-EN.
The declared unit (1 m2) is calculated based on a 2.40m x 0.451m panel.
The main product components per declared unit are shown in Table 1 below.

Technical data:
AluWood facade cladding is in conformity with the provisions of the EC Regulation No. 305/2011, Construction Product Regulation system of
assessment and verification of constancy of performance: System 3 and is in accordance with the requirements of EN 14915:2013 (Solid wood

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 m2 AluWood®
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included when specific information are missing. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and
substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
3 / 13
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
Product specific data are based on average values collected in 2024, covering the production period from 01.02.2024 to 01.11.24. A followup to
verify whether the data is accurate or varies by more than 10% will be performed in February 2025.

System boundary:
This EPD is based on a cradle-to-gate LCA, in which 100 weight-% has been accounted for.
The general rules for the exclusion of inputs and outputs follows the requirements in EN 15804, 6.3.5, where the total of neglected input flows per
module shall be a maximum of 5 % of energy usage and mass and 1 % of energy usage and mass for unit processes.
Product stage (A1-A3) includes:
A1 – Extraction and processing of raw materials
A2 – Transport to the production site
A3 – Manufacturing processes
The product stage comprises the acquisition of all raw materials, products and energy, transport to the production site, packaging and waste
processing up to the ”end-of-waste” state or final disposal. The LCA results are declared in aggregated form for the product stage, which means,
that the sub-modules A1, A2 and A3 are declared as one module A1-A3.
Transport (A4) is assumed to cover a distance of 300 km. Screws used for installation are excluded, as per NPCR 013 Part B for Steel and
Aluminium Construction Products, they are considered part of the building-level assessment. Additionally, installation is carried out manually using
hand tools, resulting in minimal energy consumption.¨
End of Life (C1-C4) includes:
End of Life (C1-C4) includes only modules C2 and C3 in the declaration. In module C1 disassembly is assumed to be performed manually, possibly
using hand tools, with minimal energy consumption. The AluWood facade elements are designed and assembled to allow for easy disassembly at
the end of their use phase, which should take place on-site. After disassembly, the components are transported to a relevant waste processing
facility. The transport distance is estimated to be 84 km.
The components of the AluWood facade elements are either recycled or incinerated with additional benefits. Treated wood is incinerated at waste-
to-energy facilities, assuming that the glue and coating remain on the wood during incineration. Aluminum sheets and screws are assumed to be
recycled, replacing primary aluminum ingots.
Re-use, recovery and recycling potential (D) includes:
The materials in the AluWood facade system contribute to benefits and burdens beyond its system boundaries. When the materials are
incinerated, they generate both electricity and heat. The electricity replaces the Danish electricity grid mix, while the heat substitutes district heating
in Denmark, with the energy distribution comprising 25% electricity and 75% heat. The energy and heat potential from the reused wood are
accounted for in accordance with cPCR 16485. Additionally, in module C3, 95% of the aluminum sheets are recycled, replacing the average
European aluminum ingots
