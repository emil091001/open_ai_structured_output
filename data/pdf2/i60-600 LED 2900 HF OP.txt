LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs i60-600 LED 2900 HF OP
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) can be excluded. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

The analysis is a cradle-to-grave study of one luminaire manufactured and installed, used according to a specific lighting regime over a specific
lifetime, including waste treatment at end-of-life.
A1-A5 includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, transport to the
market and assembly.
B6 is the operational energy use stage of the luminaire based on a scenario.
C1-C4 includes de-installation of the luminaire, average transport between building site and waste treatment facility, waste processing and
disposal. Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693.
D shows the recyclability of metals and plastics, and allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life.
The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by
the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4:
Transport from manufacturing location in Molde to warehouse in Oslo (495 km) + average distribution into the Nordic market (500 km).
Module B6:
The operational energy use of the luminaire is calculated based on the methodology provided in IBU PCR Part B for luminaires, lamps, and
components for luminaires. The energy consumption model for luminaire used in the PCR follows the application scenarios developed in EN
15193:2007. To calculate the electricity use of the luminaire, the following scenario parameters have been applied:
- User scenario = manufacture
- Active power of the luminaire (Pa) = 23 watt
- Passive power of the luminaire (Pp) = 0 watt
- Daylight time usage (tD) = 2500 hours
- Non-daylight time usage (tN) = 1500 hours
- Standard year time (ty) = 8760 hours
- The occupancy depency factor (FO) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The daylight dependency factor (FD) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The product specific constant illuminance factor (FCP) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The non-daylight dimming factor (FN) = 1 (factor, no unit)
- The application specific empiric lifetime of the luminaire in years (a) = 20 years (corresponding to the reference service life of the product)
Module C2:
Average transport to Nordic waste treatment facilities (300km).
Modules C3 and C4:
Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle assessments of electronic
and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will likely be treated during the
end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy recovery and fly ash
extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D:
The recyclability of metals, plastics, and electronic components allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a
product’s life. The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity
generated by the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

Remarks to environmental impacts
A luminaire is a product that consumes energy during the use phase. Combined with a relatively long expected lifetime and the environmental
impact of generating electricity, the use phase (B6) will normally be the most contributing stage to the overall environmental impact of the
declared unit. It is important to be aware that the actual calculations of the effect of B6 is particularly sensitive to which use scenario that is chosen
and which energy grid mix that is used.
