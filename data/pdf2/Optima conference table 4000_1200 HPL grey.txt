Declared unit: Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects

of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
Transportation to an average customer in Norway is 1916 km (A4: average European lorry > 32 tonnes) (Transport, freight, by lorry (>32t): 1426 km and by sea
transport: 490 km).
The electricity consumed is assumed to be from East pool mix in the East European countries. European mix and energy mix in Lithuania is based on data
from the World bank (Based on data 2011).
Electricity mix: 0,053 kg CO2 eqv/MJ (East Europe mix).

The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In the end of life stage, the transport distance for waste to waste processing is 72 km (C1). The reuse, recovery and recycling stage is beyond the system
boundaries (D). It is assumed that the solution is dismantled and the materials recycled. In the table below Norwegian treatment of industrial waste is
calculated. This calculation includes only CO2 emissions (GWP) in the Cmodules. The transport distance to reuse, recovery or recycling varies for each material,
but the average distance is 373 km. The vehicles used and associated data are described in detail in [5].
