LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Innimúr BM Vallá - 25kg sack
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 includes the transport of the 25kg sacks to the Icelandic market. The transport is done to two regions: Capital region (90%) and the
Northern region (10%). For the areas outside the capital region, 70% of the transport is done by ship and 30% by truck. A weighted average is
calculated with the distances for those two regions.
Module A5 includes the average waste treatment for plastic bags and wood pallets. It also includes a 5% material loss during installation, as
demanded by NPCR 009:2021.
Modules C and D not declared as allowed by NPCR 009:2021.
