small amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria
do not apply for hazardous materials and substances. For scrapped steel actual data from the specific production line is
used.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
For A1-A4 the data is actual data or suggestions from the c-CPR. For the other modules conservative assumptions have been made. For
Assembly(A5) and Deconstruction (C1) Bucht & Korhonen's report regarding Energy Consumption during Construction phase has been used.

System boundary:
Module A1-A5, C1-C4 and D is included in the analysis. That means everything except the usage stage. That is excluded since the product
has very limited effect on the environment during this phase of its lifetime.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
The after life scenario assumes 100% recycling of steel. The same energy consumption has been assumed for assembly and deconstruction.
During assembly no scrap has been assumed since the product is custom made in the right dimensions for each construction.
