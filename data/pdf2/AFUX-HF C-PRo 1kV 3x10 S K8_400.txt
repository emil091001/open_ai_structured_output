Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
The data collection at the factory has been conducted during the following period: 08/2022-07-2023. This correspond to 12 months/ a year of
production.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Module A4 = An average distance of 600 km from Prysmian Group production plant in Oulu to the market in South of Finland is considered.
Modules A5 = 2 % product losses during installation are estimated by the company. No energy use for installation has been quantified since this
operation is assumed to be done with other products and should be assessed at a construction works level. Cable drums are reused.
Modules B1, B2, B3, B5, and B7 = Company data shows that no significant activities have been reported for use, maintenance, repair, replacement,
refurbishment, and water use. This reflects an absence of impacts during the 40 years reference service life of the cable in these modules.
Module B4 = The service life of the building is the same as the service life of the product, no replacement activities are taking place in module B4
- Reference service life, building = 40 years (standard)
- Reference service life, product = 40 years (standard)
Module B6 = The operational energy use of the cable is calculated based on the methodology described in PEP Ecopassport, Product Specific Rules
(PSR) for wires, cables and accessories, reference PSR-0001-ed3-EN-2015 10 16. The following parameters are used to calculate the electricity loss
of the cable:
- Reference service life = 40 years (according to appendix 1 of the PSR)
- Number of conductors = 1 current carrying conductors (protection conductor is not transmitting power and are not included here).
- Use rate = 100 percent (according to appendix 1 of the PSR)
- Linear conductor resistivity = 0,00183 Ohm per meter
- Current intensity = 1 Ampere
Module C1 = For both buildings and construction works, cables will be taken out as part of a larger demolition. The energy use for cable removal
compared to other heaver materials is assumed to be low. This module can therefore be included with zero impact.
Module C2 = An average distance of 100 km from installation site to various end processing locations is considered.
Modules C3 and C4 = Waste treatment of the product follows the default values provided in EN 50693, Product Category Rules for life cycle
assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems, table G.4. This table specified how different types of raw materials used in A1 will
likely be treated during the end-of-life of the product. Waste treatments in C3 include material recycling and incineration with and without energy
recovery and fly ash extraction. Disposal in C4 consist of landfilling of different waste fractions and of ashes.
Module D = The recyclability of metals and plastics allows the producers a credit for the net scrap that is produced at the end of a product’s life.
The benefits from recycling of net scrap are described in formula from EN 15804:2012+A2:2019. Substitution of heat and electricity generated by
the incineration with energy recovery of plastic insulation and other parts is also calculated in module D.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
