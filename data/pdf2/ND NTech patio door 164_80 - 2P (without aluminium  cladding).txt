Allocation of energy, water and waste from production is calculated according to EN 16485:2014. This is based on the modularity

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD
The transportation from production to construction site is based on a scenario where the product is transported on a large lorry from
Poland to Oslo, Norway (1250 km) and then to a warehouse which is assumed to be in a 250 km radius from Oslo. Transport from
warehouse to a construction site is assumed to be 50 km on a medium truck.

mixed waste and sent to incineration. The combustible materials are then energy recovered, while glass is assumed to end up in the
bottom ash and then landfilled. The metals are usually sorted out of the bottom ash and then recycled, but there is no data of the share

Global warming potential in A1-A3 includes sequestration of CO2 as carbon in the wood. This amount is accounted as an emission
in module C3. Additionally, it is included sequestration in the wood packaging. This is accounted as an emission in module A5. The

To increase the transparency of the climate impacts, the GWP indicator has been divided into sub-indicators:
GWP-IOBC Climate impacts calculated according to instant oxidation principle
GWP-BCIP Climate impacts calculated from the net impacts of sequestration and emission of biogenic carbon
Climate impact without alu clad
