No variation between sites; single production site declared.
Product description
Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a common material used for thermal insulation of buildings, including floors, walls and ceilings. It is a polymer foam,
consisting of air-filled polystyrene cells. As 98% of the material is air, EPS provides good insulating properties at a low weight. Other characteristics
of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life and high compressive strength.
EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of
a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and
pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 80 provides
a density at 80 kN/m2, which is approximately 15 kg/m3. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out and the blocks are cut
into the desired shape.
Weight per declared unit is 0,57 kg given a density of 15 kg/cubic meter with a thickness of 38 mm.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:

Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
