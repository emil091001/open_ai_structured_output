LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs NorDan NTech Tilt and Turn 3 handle - ND 92/67 (With Aluminium Cladding)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main
product in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis. The PCR specific
background data follow the allocation rules in the Ecoinvent v3.7.1 Cut-off database version. The allocation of water, energy and waste flows
within the production facilities for windows and doors follows unit-based allocation adjusted with a point system to different product groups or
products. This score system is regulated by a factor which increases with the resource intensity of each product. The unit-based allocation is
adjusted by the weight of the product, excluding the weight of glass.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
Material quantities of the specified product in reference size have been calculated by NorDan's business system. The production data was collected
in 2021 and is an average for 2020.

Additional technical information:
For products with different sizes than the declared unit, the environmental impact must be recalculated using a conversion factor. The Norwegian
EPD Foundation has published instructions on how to interpret EPDs for windows on its website (www.epdnorge.no) where different calculation
methods have been stated. (Document: Bruksanvisninger i hvordan tolke EPD'er - Vinduer).

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
A4
The transportation from production to construction site is based on a scenario where the product is transported on a large truck from Moi to
warehouse in Oslo, Norway (413 km). Transport from warehouse to a construction site is assumed to be 50 km on a medium truck.
A5
According to the report from EPD-Norge Harmonising the documentation of scenarios beyond cradle to gate, EN 15804 there is no loss on site
during construction activities. The product in this EPD is painted and surface treated in the production and not at the building site. Therefore,
there is only 2 items left in this module. 1) Waste treatment of packaging which is considered in the EPD calculations. 1) Energy use during
installation. This can be varied depending on the floor, type of building and several other unknown parameters, and therefore ignored in the
calculation.
B2/B3
The maintenance scenario includes cleaning and painting. Cleaning is performed three times per year. It is calculated with 30 ml of detergent and 3
liters of water each year. Products with aluminium cladding are assumed to be painted 3 times during its lifetime from the inside. It is assumed
that 5 gr of lubricating oil is used every year for fittings and moving parts. The glazing unit is changed once during the lifetime for products with
aluminium cladding. No repair is assumed during the product lifetime.
B4/B5
* Number or RSL (Reference Service Life). The window has RSL of 60 years. Therefore, it is assumed to replace the insulated glass unit after 30
years (See Module B2). The RSL is determined by using SINTEF design guide 700.320. There is no need for refurbishment during the product
lifetime.
C1
As there are no data for de-construction, it is assumed no activities in C1 in this study. The product is assumed to be treated as mixed waste and
sent to incineration. The combustible materials are then energy recovered, while glass is assumed to end up in the bottom ash and then landfilled.
The metals are usually sorted out of the bottom ash and then recycled, but there is no data of the share which are recycled and therefore
standard values from Ecoinvent is utilized.
C2
The transport of the product as waste is calculated based on a scenario with 50 km distance.
C3
Windows are assumed to be sorted as mixed construction waste and treated with incineration with energy recovery. However, the manufacturer
has documented the recycling potentials for its product in the Building Product Declaration (BPD).
BPD is published on NorDan's public document system, NDocs. In the documentation, chapter 10, the specific material and energy recovery
potential is reported for the product.
URL: https://portal.nordan.no/ndocs/search?category=document_EPD
C1, C3, C4
The benefits beyond life cycle have been modelled based on the output flows from module C3. This includes energy from incineration and scrap
metal recovered from the ashes. The amount recovered metal is assumed to avoid production of primary metals in accordance to 6.4.3.3 in EN
15804. The exported energy is substituting Norwegian district heating mix and electricity mix. Inventory processes causing substitution of avoided
virgin raw materials has been constructed for each material.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon​
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.​
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
