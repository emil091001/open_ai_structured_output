LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
In A4, a transport distance from the production site to Elektroskandia’s warehouse in Langhus was included. A distance of 300 km was also added as
additional transport to market. Installation in trenches (A5) and removal (C1) is assumed to be done with other products such as piping systems and should
be assessed at a contruction works level. For B1-B7 the default environmental impact and resource indicators in the EPD are assumed to be zero. Some other
potential environmental impacts from the use phase might not be covered by the scope of an EPD. In C3 metals such as copper and aluminium are sent to
recycling and other materials such as plastic insulation is sent to municipal incineration. Net benefit of material recycling and energy recovery is given in
module D. Both aluminium and copper will replace a market average process for the metals in Europe.
