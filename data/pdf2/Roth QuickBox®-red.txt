Product:
Product description:
Roth QuickBox®-red is developed to meet today’s requirements for corrosion-resistant installations. Roth QuickBox®-red can be used for wall or
panel wall (additional accessories required) for 15 mm PEX pipes in a 25 mm corrugated pipe. Roth QuickBox®-red is made of transparent,
molded plastic with a pre-mounted red brass elbow and pressure testing plug. The pre-mounted sealing nipple and lock are approved according
to NT VVS 129 and meets the requirements of the SBI 252 guidelines. Roth’s QuickBox®-red is delivered as a single box with a push-fit coupling
for 15 mm. The push-fit coupling ensures a quick and secure connection. Armaturfix can be used where a double box for the wall is desired.

Technical data:
The plastic housing is molded in transparent polycarbonate (PC). The sealing nipple is made of glass fiber reinforced PP with lips of TPR. The lock
for the corrugated pipe is made of GF reinforced ABS. The gasket for the elbow is made of EPDM rubber.
The push-fit elbow is made of red brass with a ½” internal thread. The integrated locking ring in the elbow is made of stainless steel, the O-ring is
made of EPDM rubber, and the release ring and support ring are made of acetal plastic. The included liner is made of stainless steel AISI/SUS 316.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Roth QuickBox®-red
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Module A1: Packaging has been included by average use of packaging pr. 1 kg of product.
Module A4: The transportation distances provided in this EPD are derived from precise data concerning the distances between production facility
and and various sales departments in different countries. Subsequently, it is assumed that the distribution from each of these sales departments to
the end customers an approximate distance of 300 km*.
*Transportation by truck is assumed on a distributon of 80% EURO 6 and 20% EURO 5, based on data from the companys own logistics provider.
Module C2: The estimated transportion distance to the waste handling facility in this EPD is 100 km, assuming the use of a truck as the transport
method.
Additional technical information:
*It should be noted that some of the articles that we supply do contain Lead above the 0.1% by weight threshold, however the lead is a part of a
metal alloy in our brass products (not copper). Due to the chemical bonding within the alloy, there is no risk of any exposure, and no further
information or markings are required for safe use. As noted in RoHS Annex III, Exemption (6c) was granted for lead in copper and brass alloys,
allowing up to 4% lead (Pb) by weight. Our products are 2% lead by weight maximum.
