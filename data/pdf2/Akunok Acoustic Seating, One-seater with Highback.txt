Product
Product description:
This acoustic furniture concept by Abstracta and designer Maja Ganszyniec ambitiously tackles two of the biggest challenges facing many of
today’s workplaces. The first is to create better soundscapes that promote well-being and job satisfaction. The second is to offer employees
secluded, quiet smaller areas where they can focus on their work in comfort, either alone or in small groups.
A play on the words acoustic and nook, Akunok is about carefully created seclusion — rather than establishing enclosed rooms.
Akunok is designed for dynamic environments characterised by noise and movement, such as open-plan offices and co-working spaces. It is also
ideal for furnishing lobbies, libraries and reading rooms.
For more information about the product, visit the product page https://abstracta.se/product/akunok-acoustic-seating/
Product specification
The Akunok Acoustic Seating are generously sized, with pocket springs for maximum comfort, and sound-absorbing infill. They are marked by
uncompromising quality and attention to detail, such as their beautiful French seam and a tubular steel base that protrudes just enough to give
Akunok its unique character inspired by Japanese interiors. Akunok is available in a selection of fabrics and colours. Its base comes in several
colours.
This EPD includes these variants:

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 pcs Akunok Acoustic Seating, One-seater with Highback
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The EPD is a cradle-to-cradle analysis, A1-D, where some B-stages (use phase) that were assumed to be neglectable are not included.
The A1-A4 stages includes the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, and
an estimated transport distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after assembly at the
customer.
The only B stage that is assumed to be relevant is B2. This stage includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to
Abstracta's care instructions.
The C- and D-stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management, the waste processes,
disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.
Additional technical information:
To preserve the fabric colour and the appearance of the fabric, Akunok should be vacuumed regularly with a soft nozzle.
Polyester Stain Removal: Use uncoloured paper towel or cloth to soak up as much as possible of the stain. Dried stains should be vacuumed.
Moisten the stain lightly with a clean white cotton cloth, lukewarm water and possibly a small amount of pH-neutral detergent. Press a dry cloth
or uncoloured paper towel against the fabric so that moisture and dirt are absorbed. Repeat moistening and soaking until the stain is gone. Use
clean water without detergent at the last moistening. Finish with soaking.
Wool Stain Removal: Dab or wipe gently with a moist cloth.
Abstracta offers a reuse service for our clients. This involves us collecting worn-out products to facilitate reuse, renovation, or recycling. In order to
make circularity easier, most of our products feature replaceable parts, simplifying repair. We do this in the hope that we can help contribute in the
transition to a more sustainable future. Read more about the service here: https://abstracta.se/story/abstracta-is-introducing-a-new-recycling-
service-for-used-products-abstracta/ or contact our Sales Support for more information. Otherwise, try to ensure that the product can be reused
when possible, or else, dismantle it so that as much of the materials can be recycled as possible.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to a
customer in Scandinavia, Germany, the UK, or France (88% of sales in 2023). An average distance to the customer has been calculated through
this data. In the A5 phase, the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts are added automatically according to assumptions made
in the EPD tool on waste handling on-site. In the use stage, the assumption is that the customer takes care of the product by vacuuming it for 1
minute/m2 of the product, with a 600 W vacuum, on a yearly basis. For the end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is a
50 km distance from the customer to a waste terminal. The rest of the values are automatically filled in by the tool. For the D-stage, automatic
values are filled in, according to generic data.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
