Product
Product description:
Protecta FR Adhesive contains a water based inorganic polymer and filler, and is designed to withstand temperatures greater than 1,200 °C. It is
supplied as a ready to use thixotropic paste which exhibits excellent early grab and rapid bond strength.
After curing the product forms a cement with a permanent bond giving excellent adhesion in service.
FR Adhesive can be used both as an adhesive and as a filler, with multiple usages where bonding or sealing very hot surfaces is required, or
sustaining a seal or a bond within a fire situation without detachment.

LCA: Calculation rules
Declared unit:
1 kg Protecta FR Adhesive (pail)
Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not​ apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

System boundary:
The life cycle analysis is a cradle-to-gate (A1 - A3) study. It includes the extraction and production of raw materials and packaging, transportation
to the manufacturing site, as well as the manufacturing process itself.
Additional technical information:
Protecta FR Adhesive can be removed with a knife/scraper and disposed of at an approved waste facility.
Polyseam's factory is certified according to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organisations
to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.
