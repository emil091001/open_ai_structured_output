The following example illustrates the net scrap calculation for this model:
362 kg scrap is used in the manufacturing of 1 metric ton of structural hollow section. After use, 880 kg steel is
recycled, 110 kg is reused and 10 kg are landfilled. The potential environmental impact calculated for module D
depends on the net amount of scrap left in the system, which is 880 – 362 + 40 = 558. This means that the
system has a net output of 558 kg scrap, which carries a potential credit. All in all module D shows an
environmental benefit.
