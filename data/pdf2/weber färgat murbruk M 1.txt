apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other

System boundary:
All processes from raw material extraction, product transport, the construction site, assembly, end of product life and beyond the system boundaries are
included in the analysis. The basic production process involves mixing of various raw materials.
The flow chart below illustrates the system boundaries for the full life cycle analysis.
Additional technical information:
The remaining powder and cured material may be disposed as construction waste to disposal or recycling.
The packaging properly emptied is not classified as hazardous waste.
