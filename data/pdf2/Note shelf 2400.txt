Open office landscapes need clearly defined areas. Note is an object to
Reference service life, product
help define the transition from one area to another. From work space
to socializing, changing the codex and interaction. A well thought out 15 years
design will help create better landscapes. Note is also a tool to
Reference service life, building
comminicate an organizations values to the organsization. A well
thought out collection of objects on display will tell the users what
matters to your company. Note consists of 26mm MDF shelf plates
separated by 17mm mdf dividers placed diagonally every other way.
The stability is maintained by transversely placing the vertical dividers of
the shelf. The effect this creates is an exciting pattern that ensures
visibility from all angles. The Note design has few components
providing efficient and environmentally friendly flat-packed logistics,
with easy assembly almost without any of tools.

of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product
Cut-off criteria: in which the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of
the material is allocated to this analysis.
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The
production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not
apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were collected for
EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research databases, ecoinvent and other
LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.
