The transportation distance to waste processing system (module C2) is considered as 30 km. Specifically, for
scenario 3, i.e. recycling, the transportation distance to the brick industry is 100 km, hence multiply the results in
module C2 by 3.33 (i.e.,100/30) to get the result for 100 km.
The environmental impacts of the coated product are to be assessed with the help of a markup factor in the
amount of 0.8% for Global Warming Potential and for all LCA results, the maximum deviation is 5.44%.
Disclaimer 1 - for the indicator IRPT This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose
ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential
ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 - The results of environmental impact indicators ADPE, ADPF, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP
shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited experience with the
indicator.
6. LCA: Interpretation
The contributions from module A1 (raw materials) and Photochemical ozone formation, net freshwater use;
A3 (energy) dominate in climate change impact. The around 82% contribution in Acidification potential and
modules A4, A5, C1, C2, C3 and C4 contributes less. around 50% contribution in Resource use (energy
The credits in this study ie D result from the carriers) and Total use of renewable and non-
incineration of packaging materials. Module D/2 credit renewable primary energy resources. The other
is highest as the 100% manufacturing impacts of the relevant contributor is Feldspar contributing around
product are taken as a credit for its 100% reuse. 30% in Resource use (energy carriers) and Total use
of renewable and non-renewable primary energy
The significant contributor (> 50%) and relevant resources. 72% of Resource use (mineral and metals)
contributor (25% - 50%) among all the raw materials is contributed by Manganese dioxide as the use of
for most of the impact categories is Sodium carbonate, manganese ore for its production leads to depletion of
with around 60% contribution in Climate change, 70%- mineral and metal resource.
77% contribution in Eutrophication of freshwater,
