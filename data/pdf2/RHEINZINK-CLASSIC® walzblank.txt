2.6 Manufacture
Structure of the manufacturing process:
The manufacturing process comprises seven steps:
Pre-alloy:
To improve the quality, and for energy-saving reasons, a pre-
alloy is produced at 760 °C in an induction crucible (melting of
SHG zinc, copper, titanium and aluminium). The pre-alloy

essential characteristics according to EN 14782 and EN 14783
respectively.
Melting:
Constructional data The pre-alloy blocks and SHG zinc are melted in large melting
furnaces (induction furnaces) at 500 – 550 °C and mixed by
induction currents.
Casting:
The final alloy is cooled down below melting point with a closed
water circuit in the casting machine, resulting in a solid cast
string.

5. LCA: Results
The following Figure shows the relative contribution of the production stages (Module A1-A3), waste treatment (Module C2, C3, C4)
and the benefits and loads beyond the product system boundary (Module D).
The production of the high-grade zinc is the dominating contributor to all indicators of the impact assessment (73%-100%) as main raw
material, followed by the generation of electricity. Only for ODP, the electricity dominates the results due to the use of electricity from
Photovoltaic[1].
The high credits given in module D are the results of the 100% recyclability of the zinc products. At the EoL of the zinc products a
collection rate of 95% was assumed. The remaining 5% are forwarded to the waste treatment (module C4). Overall, C4 has a
minimized contribution.
In the case of the ODP, module D is positive since the Zinc-scrap re-melting process uses electricity with a higher share of photovoltaic
than the credited Zinc production. The electricity from Photovoltaic dominates the ODP (same as in module A1-A3) due to the emission
of emission flow dichloro-1-fluoroethane (R 141b) and chlorodifluoethane (R 142b) which are the precursors of Polyvinylidene fluorine
(PVDF) used in the production of PV modules.
