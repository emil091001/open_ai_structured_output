Data quality:
The CEPE database is used as basis for the rawmaterial composition. Specific datafor theproduct composition and rawmaterial
amounts has been provided bythe manufacturer and represents the production of the declared product. Production site data was
collected in 2020, with 2019 as reference year. Remaining data is based on Ecoinvent v3.6, but adjusted to improve
representativeness. All energy consumption in the database is assumed not to be used as raw material.
Cut-off criteria: Allocation:
All major raw materials and essential energy is included. The Theallocationismadeinaccordancewiththeprovisionsof
