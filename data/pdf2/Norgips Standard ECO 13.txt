Product
Product description:
Norgips Standard ECO 13 Type A is a gypsum board composed of a plaster core encased in and firmly bonded to paper liners. The front and back
paper liners are overlapped and glued together on the backside of the board. The product is particularly suitable for the cladding of internal walls,
ceilings and partitions in all types of buildings. The board is classified for use in fire-rated construction and will provide very good sound insulation.
Norgips Standard ECO 13 is produced with 100% renewable electric energy and liquefied biogas (LBG).
Product specification
Norgips Standard ECO 13 gypsum board is produced in various widths and lengths, but with the same
thickness. Therefore there are no variations of the product per square meter.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included when specific information are missing. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and
substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. The data represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on EPDs according to EN 15804 and different LCA databases. The
data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.

Additional technical information:
The calcined recycled gypsum is transferred to the mixer where water and additives are added. The slurry is distributed to a plasterboard liner
where the edges are folded and a new layer of plasterboard liner is glued on to form a sandwich. The board line is continuous transferred along the
production line, cut to suitable lengths and dried in a kiln. The dried boards are cut to the correct lengths and stacked in pallets.

2. This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due
to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from
radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
