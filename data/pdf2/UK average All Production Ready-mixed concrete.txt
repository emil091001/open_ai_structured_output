Product
Product description
Concrete is a building material made up of several components, including cement, water, sand, gravel, and air. Ready-mixed concrete is
manufactured in a batch plant in a controlled environment, using precise mix designs (with the addition of other cementitious materials or
chemical admixtures that improve the properties of the concrete), ensuring consistency in quality, strength, and composition. This
consistency leads to predictable performance in construction projects. Ready-mixed concrete is then delivered to the construction site in
an unhardened state, ready to use, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. This saves time in labour, equipment setup, and material
handling, speeding up the construction process. The product is produced according to BS 8500 and BS EN 206. Testing was conducted
according to BS EN 12350 and BS EN 12390. Performance data of the product with respect to its characteristics in accordance with the
relevant technical provision (no CE-marking).

The most common man-made substance in the world is concrete. Regardless of the magnitude of the construction, it is a
necessary component of roads, buildings, bridges, dams, pavements, pipelines, sewers, and other structures. It is made up of
naturally occurring aggregates with varying granulometries (sand, fine gravel, and gravel) joined by hydrated cement paste.
To improve particular qualities of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability, durability, or early and final strength,
chemical admixtures can also be used. After manufacture, concrete is workable enough to be transported, poured, pumped,
put in place, and compacted at the project site, where it gradually solidifies and gains strength.

Formwork and Falsework each contribute less than 1% of the total product CO2 emissions, and are therefore neglected
under cut-off rules. (Kaethner, Burridge, 2012). Other sources: Concrete waste: Adams & Hobbs (2023). Electricity, Diesel:

consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing
radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
