Product
Product description:
Stitch is a soft and cosy-looking, sound-absorbent screen upholstered in thick, padded fabric with grid-patterned stitching, and mounted on finely
made ash wood legs. Inspired by sofas, cushions and down-filled jackets, Stefan Borselius's aim in designing Stitch was to make often hard and
angular public spaces more welcoming by adding an element of human warmth. For the same reason, Stitch is equally suited to home
environments. Needless to say, its design language also delivers excellent acoustic properties.
For more information about the product, visit the product page https://abstracta.se/product/stitch-floor/.
Product specification
The screen consists of a wooden frame, with a cover made of sound absorbing fibre filling upholstered with thick lined fabric with embroidered
check patterns. The product is sold without a leg set, but a standard choice for the leg set is included in the EPD.

Cut-off criteria:
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. The production processes for raw materials and energy flows with very small
amounts (less than 1%) are not included. These cut-off criteria do not apply for hazardous materials and substances.
Allocation:
The allocation is made in accordance with the provisions of EN 15804. Incoming energy and water and waste production in-house is allocated
equally among all products through mass allocation. Effects of primary production of recycled materials is allocated to the main product in which
the material was used. The recycling process and transportation of the material is allocated to this analysis.
Data quality:
Specific data for the product composition are provided by the manufacturer. They represent the production of the declared product and were
collected for EPD development in the year of study. Background data is based on registered EPDs according to EN 15804, Ostfold Research
databases, ecoinvent and other LCA databases. The data quality of the raw materials in A1 is presented in the table below.​

System boundary:
The analysis is a cradle-to-cradle, A1-D, where some B-stages that were assumed to be neglectable are not included. The A1-A4 stages includes
the extraction and production of raw materials, transportation to the production site, the production process itself, and an estimated transport
distance to the market. A5 includes the generated waste from the packaging of the product after the assembly at the customer. The only B-stage
that is assumed to be relevant is B2, which includes assumptions on how the customer takes care of the product according to Abstracta's care
instructions. The C- and D-stages includes the use of materials and energy for deconstruction, the transport to waste management, the waste
processes, disposal of materials that cannot be processed, and the potential of reuse, recovery, and recycling of the product.
Additional technical information:
To preserve the fabric colour and the appearance of the fabric, Stitch should be vacuumed regularly with a soft nozzle.
Polyester Stain Removal: Use uncoloured paper towels or cloth to soak up as much as possible of the stain. Dried stains should be vacuumed.
Moisten the stain lightly with a clean white cotton cloth, lukewarm water and possibly a small amount of pH-neutral detergent. Press a dry cloth
or uncoloured paper towel against the fabric so that the moisture and dirt are absorbed. Repeat moistening and soaking until the stain is gone.
Use clean water without detergent at the last moistening. Finish with soaking.
Abstracta offers a reuse service for our clients. This involves us collecting worn-out products to facilitate reuse, renovation, or recycling. In order to
make circularity easier, most of our products feature replaceable parts, simplifying repair. We do this in the hope that we can help contribute in the
transition to a more sustainable future. Read more about the service here: https://abstracta.se/story/abstracta-is-introducing-a-new-recycling-
service-for-used-products-abstracta/ or contact our Sales Support for more information. Otherwise, try to ensure that the product can be reused
when possible, or else, dismantle it so that as much of the materials can be recycled as possible.

LCA: Scenarios and additional technical information
The following information describe the scenarios in the different modules of the EPD.
Some assumptions have been made regarding the products lifetime after leaving the factory gates. The product is assumed to be transported to a
customer in Scandinavia, the UK, or France (85% of sales in 2022). An average distance to the customer has been calculated through this data. In
the A5 phase, the packaging of the product becomes waste, and the impacts are added automatically according to assumptions made in the EPD
tool on waste handling on-site. In the use stage, the assumption is that the customer takes care of the product by vacuuming it on a yearly basis.
For the end-of-life stage of the product, it has been assumed that there is a 50 km distance from the customer to a waste terminal. The rest of the
values are automatically filled in by the tool. For the D-stage, automatic values are filled in, according to generic data.

GWP-IOBC: Global warming potential calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation. In order to increase the transparency of biogenic carbon
contribution to climate impact, the indicator GWP-IOBC is required as it declares climate impacts calculated according to the principle of instantaneous oxidation.
GWP-IOBC is also referred to as GWP-GHG in context to Swedish public procurement legislation.
