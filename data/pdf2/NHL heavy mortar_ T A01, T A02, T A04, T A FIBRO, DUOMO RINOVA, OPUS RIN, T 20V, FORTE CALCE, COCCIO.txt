2. Product
2.1 Product description
The premixed Miniera San Romedio’s products are inorganic finely grinded materials, obtained by
means of the combinations at different relative concentrations of natural hydraulic lime, cement and
dolomia. In this EPD the NHL heavy mortar is considered.
2.2 Application
NHL heavy mortar: a ready-to-use mortar, designed for the improvement of living healthiness and
comfort, and for use in restoration works, thanks to its particular composition based only on dolomia
and NHL. Products of this category are subjected to CE marking according to EN998-1 (Dry-Idro, Dry
rin, Nuraghe, Calce fine, Calce media, Duomo rinova, Opus, Opus mec, Opus rin, T A Fibro, T A01, T
A02, T A04), EN998-2 (Forte calce, Eco build, T 20V). Calce dilavato, Coccio vivo, Pavi eco, Duomo and

2.4 Placing on the market/ Application rules
The pre-mixed Miniera San Romedio’s products are powder or granulates and therefore they have to
be transported to the building site by using 25 kg paper bags, collected over a pallet. Pallets range from
50 to 60 bags each one, and can be mechanically moved. Once the product reaches the building site
the bags can be used to mix the product with the specified amount of water and either be manually
stirred or mechanically mixed. It can be also transported to the construction site unpackaged and di-
rectly pumped into a silo already settled on a nearby position.
2.5 Base materials / Ancillary materials
In order to apply this product, it must be premixed combining at different relative concentrations nat-
ural hydraulic lime, acting as the inorganic binder, cement and the fillers (i.e dolomia). Water and small
amounts of additives (less than 3 wt%) are then added to the mix, in order to develop innovative ma-
terials with very peculiar properties and suitable for a wide range of applications in the constructions
field. The relative composition of the NHL heavy mortar is summarized in Table 2.

2.6 Manufacturing
2.6.1. Manufacturing process of the binder
The unprocessed marlstone is extracted from the pit in Predaia (TN), through a mixed explosive. The
obtained marlstone is then collected through a Diesel bulldozer and transported with a Diesel lorry
from Predaia (TN) to the Ville d’Anaunia (TN) facility, where the material is subjected to a first crushing.
After the first crushing of the marlstone, part of this material is used as corrective and it is not crushed
anymore, but it is transported into a specific hopper. Through a conveyor belt the crushed marlstone
that is not intended to be used as corrective is then transported to the cooking plant, fed with hard
coal. In the cooking plant, the material is subjected to a slow thermal treatment at 900-1200 °C, that
can last up to 48 hours, and the treated material is then transported through a conveyor belt in the
maturation hopper. After the thermal treatment, the material is then subjected to a first and a second
milling phase, in order to reach the required granulometry. The lime-based end product (i.e. the
binder) is obtained by mixing the milled lime, the setting retardant and the corrective marlstone (i.e.
the marlstone extracted from the pit of Predaia, transported to the cooking plant, milled and not sub-
jected to the thermal treatment).
2.6.2 Manufacturing of the lime based premixed products
The lime used in the premixed products as binder is loaded on a truck and trasported from the Ville
d’Anaunia (TN) plant to the Mollaro (TN) facility, and put in a cisterns. The powders (NHL and dolomia)
are then mixed and packed through a bagging system, by using a paper bag with capacity of 25 kg,
palletized and then directly distributed.
According to the EN 15804:2012+A2:2019 standard, the present LCA study was performed following
the so-called from-cradle-to-gate approach with modules C1-C4 and D considering thus the following
steps:
● Extraction and processing of the raw materials (A1);
● Transport of the acquired raw materials to the manufacturer and internal transport of the ex-
tracted raw materials (A2);
● Production of the materials and mixing operations (A3).
● Deconstruction/demolition (C1)
● Transport of demolition wastes (C2)
● Waste treatment (C3)
● Waste disposal (C4)
● Benefits and impacts beyond the system boundaries (D)

3.3 Estimates and assumptions
The electrical energy consumed in Miniera San Romedio Srl plants is a fully renewable certified energy.
The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained cer-
tification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage
to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the re-
newability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns
the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of
787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calo-
rific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered.
For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes
were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case.
In particular,
• for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a
productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was
considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3/m3 was considered. Both references were taken
from Ivanica et al.
• for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del
Riciclo referred to the year 2021.
• for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL heavy mortar can be fully recycled and due to the
lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after
a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste
state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the
year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to
the specific case.
• for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to
gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used
Page | 6 Miniera San Romedio — NHL heavy mortar
refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were
therefore evaluated.
According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime
can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon
dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was
considered that:
• for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the
lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure.
• for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum
theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled
wastes.
• for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum
theoretical carbon dioxide uptake.
The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values:
• Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO /ton.
2
It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no
control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to cal-
culate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B).
Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond
the boundaries of the system.
3.4 Cut-off Criteria
As reported in the EN 15804:2012+A2:2019 standard, all inputs and outputs for which data are availa-
ble were taken into account in the calculation. Eventual data gaps have been filled with conservative
assumptions of average data or generic data available in the Ecoinvent v3.8 database of the SimaPro
software. All flows contributing to more than 1 % of the total mass, energy or environmental impact
of the system have been included in the life cycle assessment. Eventual neglected processes do not
contribute in total more than 5% to the impact categories considered. Moreover, the manufacture of
machinery, plants and other infrastructure required for production of the products under review was
not taken into consideration in the present analysis.
3.5 Period under review and Geographical reference area
The specific data were obtained directly by the commissioning company, and are related to the pro-
duction of one year. The data are referred to the period June 2021-June 2022. They were obtained by
means of specific measures related to the energy consumption and mass flows in the plant of Ville
d’Anaunia (Trento), where the NHL is produced, and to the mass and energy flows in the plant of Mol-
laro (Trento), where Dolomia is extracted and mixed with NHL and packed. Manufacturer-specific data
are referred to the period 2021-2022, while generic data are less than 10 years old. Moreover, process-
specific data are based on the average of an operating year.
3.6 Data quality
For this study, the data quality requirements defined in ISO 14044 regulation have been considered.
In order to ensure coherence, data with the same level of detail have been used, as well as under the
same methodological considerations. Data and methods used for this study have been described with
Page | 7 Miniera San Romedio — NHL heavy mortar
the purpose of being reproducible by a third independent party. Whenever possible, generic data used
for the study are representative of the location where the process belongs (for example, the produc-
tion of electrical energy). The data has been collected from the plants of Ville D’Anaunia and Mollaro
(both in province of Trento). Data were associated to a specific input selected from the database Ecoin-
vent v3.8 (2021). The inventory analysis has been thus modelled by using the SimaPro software.
3.7 Allocation
In this work, allocations have been avoided as far as possible (e.g. by system expansion, splitting pro-
cesses into sub-processes). Where it was necessary, an economical allocation principle was utilized.
This choice was performed because the economic difference between product and co-products was
rather elevated. In this sense, the environmental impacts associated with the inputs have been distrib-
uted according to the way they affect the subsequent production process.
A peculiar feature of the cave in Mollaro is that the extraction of the dolomia is performed for two
interconnected purposes: obtaining the inerts to be mixed with the NHL in the premixed products of
Tassullo, and creating the spaces to store the apples produced in Trentino by Melinda Spa company
and creating spaces to store alimentary products or to host other industrial activities, which is planned
for the near future. Because of this reason, the extraction of the dolomia from the plant of Mollaro is
subjected to a specific mineralogical design which takes into account the development of large cham-
bers. The necessity to apply a different mineralogical excavation technique, very far from the optimized
mining technique traditionally used for the extraction of the inerts, involves a larger demand of energy
and explosive. In particular the excavation for the storage of apples, taken as reference because prev-
alent storage activity, compared to the traditional optimized mining technique, implies a surplus of the
mining costs of the 79% for Miniera San Romedio Srl company. Therefore, in this study only the 21%
of the environmental impact coming from the extraction of the dolomia has been attributed to Miniera
San Romedio Srl, following the economical allocation principle, while the remaining part was consid-
ered as an input of the LCA system of Melinda Spa. On the other hand, all the operations related to
the subsequent crushing and transportation of dolomia have been fully attributed to the present sys-
tem, as the extracted dolomia is fully utilized by Miniera San Romedio Srl as inert material for the
preparation of pre-mixed products.
3.8 Comparability
In order to assure the comparability of the obtained results, all datasets to be compared have been
created in accordance with EN 15804, and the product-specific performance characteristics have been
taken into account. In principle, a comparison or assessment of the environmental impacts of different
products is only possible if they have been prepared in accordance with EN 15804.

5. LCA: Results
Table 5 shows the results of the impact assessment indicators, resource use, waste and other output
streams for the declared unit (1 ton of NHL heavy mortar). The results presented here refer to the
declared product. In Table 6 the results of the biogenic carbon content are reported.
Disclaimer on ADP-e, ADP-f, WDP, ETP-fw, HTP-c, HTP-nc, SQP: The results of these environmental
impact indicators must be used with caution, as the uncertainties in these results are high or as there
is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer on IR: This impact category mainly addresses the potential effect of low dose ionizing radi-
ation on human health in the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear
accidents and occupational exposures, nor does it consider radioactive waste disposal in underground
facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from soil, radon, and some building materials is also not measured
by this indicator.
