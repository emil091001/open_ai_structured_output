Disclaimer 1 – for the indicator 'Potential Human exposure efficiency relative to U235'. This impact category deals mainly with the
eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible
nuclear accidents, occupational exposure or radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities.
Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
Disclaimer 2 – for the indicators 'abiotic depletion potential for non-fossil resources', 'abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources' and
'water (user) deprivation potential, deprivation-weighted water consumption'. The results of these environmental impact indicators shall
be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high as there is limited experience with the indicator.
Disclaimer 3 – for the indicators PM = Potential incidence of disease due to PM emissions; IR = Potential Human exposure efficiency
relative to U235; ETP-fw = Potential comparative Toxic Unit for ecosystems; HTP-c = Potential comparative Toxic Unit for humans

results of these environmental impact indicators are not declared in the EPD as the uncertainties on these results are high and as there
is limited experience with the indicators.
